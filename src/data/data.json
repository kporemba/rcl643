    "description1": "In 1919 a group of interested citizens of New Toronto comprising mainly veterans and wives, widows and mothers of veterans formed an association known as “The New Toronto Comfort Association. Their main objective was to assist First World War veterans and their families and to raise funds for a cenotaph that would be a fitting memorial to the men and women of New Toronto who had paid the supreme sacrifice in the war. This was successfully accomplished the same year and on November 11, 1919, the cenotaph was dedicated during the Rememberance Day Service. It was situation on the southwest corner of Lakeshore Road and Eight Street.",
    "description2": "After the Second World War, the Goodyear Overseas Veterans Association and the Anaconda Veterans Association met the members of Branch 3 each year, without fail at the old cenotaph on the corner of Lakeshore Road and Eighth Street on November 11th for memorial services.",
    "description3": "The Goodyear Vets paraded from the Goodyear, the Anaconda Vets paraded from the Anaconda and Branch 3 paraded from the old Legion Hall on Seventh Street__each arriving about five minutes to the hour for the service. After the service the respective groups paraded back to their starting points.",
    "description4": "In 1953 a delegation from Branch 3 met with the mayor and council at the Twon of New Toronto with the intent on having a new cenotaph constructed in a more convenient and prominent location which would commemorate not only the First World War dead of 1914-1918 but also those who gave their lives for their country in the Second World War of 1939 - 45 and the Korean war of 1950-53.",
    "description5": "After many meetings the town father passed a resolution that a new cenotaph would be erected on property adjacent to the Town Hall on the southeast corner of Birmingham and Fifth Streets. It was duly erected and was dedication on the Remembrance Day Service on November 1954. The last service at this location was November 1982 as after further negotiations with the New City of Etobicoke this Cenotaph and the older one were both relocated to where you see them today in from of our present building - just in ime for our Remembrance Day Service in November 1983.",
    "description6": "At the VE Day Service on May 6, 1984 the members of Branch 3 gathered together to witness the re-dedication of these two cenotaphs and consecration of the ground they stand on as a constant reminder of those men and women who made the supreme sacrifice on behalf of their country and fellow men during both World Wars and the Korean War.",
    "description7": "Each year services at the cenotaph are held on the Sunday before November I 1th this being the beginning of Poppy Week on November 11th at 11:00 a.m. a small group of veterans gather at the cenotaph for a short wreath laying service in memory of those who paid the supreme sacrifice.",
