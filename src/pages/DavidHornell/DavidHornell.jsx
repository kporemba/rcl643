          David Ernest Hornell was born in Toronto, Ontario on 26 January 1910.
          In 1941 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), qualified
          as a pilot and was commissioned in 1942. At the time of the action for
          which he received the Victoria Cross posthumously, Flight Lieutenant
          Hornell was flying as aircraft captain on Consolidated Canso
          amphibians with No. 162 (Bomber Reconnaissance) Squadron, RCAF from
          Royal Air Force (RAF) Station Wick in Northern Scotland.
          <br />
          <br />
          Late in the day on 24 June 1944, Hornell’s Canso was at the end of a
          12-hour patrol over the North Atlantic when the German submarine
          U-1225 was sighted on the surface approximately 120 miles north of the
          Shetland Islands. As the aircraft made its attack run, heavy and
          accurate anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat crippled the starboard
          engine and started a fire on the starboard wing. With great
          determination and skill, Hornell held the vibrating Canso on course
          and delivered his four depth charges on target, sinking the submarine.
          Shortly thereafter the starboard engine fell out of the wing, forcing
          Flight Lieutenant Hornell to ditch the aircraft, by now a flaming
          wreck, in the heavy seas. With only one dinghy serviceable, for
          several hours the eight members of the crew had to take turns holding
          on to the life-raft’s side while immersed in the icy water. Although
          the dinghy was spotted by a Consolidated Catalina flying boat from No.
          333 (Norwegian) Squadron, RAF five hours after Hornell had ditched,
          for the next 16 hours rescue attempts were frustrated by high seas and
          malfunctioning equipment. Two of the crew eventually died of exposure.
          At one point, Flight Lieutenant Hornell had to be restrained by his
          comrades when, though at the end of his own strength and about to go
          blind, he proposed to swim to an airborne lifeboat that had been
          dropped. Finally, after 21 hours, a rescue launch arrived to pick up
          the survivors, but all attempts to revive Hornell failed, and he died
          of exposure.
          <br />
          <br />
          Flight Lieutenant Hornell was the first member of the RCAF to be
          awarded the Victoria Cross.

          “Flight Lieutenant Hornell was captain and first pilot of a
          twin-engined amphibian aircraft engaged on an anti-submarine patrol in
          northern waters. The patrol had lasted for some hours when a
          fully-surfaced U-boat was sighted, travelling at high speed on the
          port beam. Flight Lieutenant Hornell at once turned to the attack.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          The U-boat altered course. The aircraft had been seen and there could
          be no surprise. The U-boat opened up with anti-aircraft fire which
          became increasingly fierce and accurate.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          At a range of 1,200 yards, the front guns of the aircraft replied;
          then its starboard guns jammed, leaving only one gun effective. Hits
          were obtained on and around the conning-tower of the U-boat, but the
          aircraft was itself hit, two large holes appearing in the starboard
          wing.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          Ignoring the enemy’s fire, Flight Lieutenant Hornell carefully
          manoeuvred for the attack. Oil was pouring from his starboard engine,
          which was, by this time, on fire, as was the starboard wing; and the
          petrol tanks were endangered. Meanwhile, the aircraft was hit again
          and again by the U-boat’s guns. Holed in many places, it was vibrating
          violently and very difficult to control.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          Nevertheless, the captain decided to press home his attack, knowing
          that with every moment the chances of escape for him and his gallant
          crew would grow more slender. He brought his aircraft down very low
          and released his depth charges in a perfect straddle. The bows of the
          U-boat were lifted out of the water; it sank and the crew were seen in
          the sea.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          Flight Lieutenant Hornell contrived, by superhuman efforts at the
          controls, to gain a little height. The fire in the starboard wing had
          grown more intense and the vibration had increased. Then the burning
          engine fell off. The plight of aircraft and crew was now desperate.
          With the utmost coolness, the captain took his aircraft into wind and,
          despite the manifold dangers, brought it safely down on the heavy
          swell. Badly damaged and blazing furiously, the aircraft rapidly
          settled.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          After ordeal by fire came ordeal by water. There was only one
          serviceable dinghy and this could not hold all the crew. So they took
          turns in the water, holding on to the sides. Once, the dinghy capsized
          in the rough seas and was righted only with great difficulty. Two of
          the crew succumbed from exposure.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          An airborne lifeboat was dropped to them but fell some 500 yards down
          wind. The men struggled vainly to reach it and Flight Lieutenant
          Hornell, who throughout had encouraged them by his cheerfulness and
          inspiring leadership, proposed to swim to it, through he was nearly
          exhausted. He was with difficulty restrained. The survivors were
          finally rescued after they had been in the water for 21 hours. By this
          time Flight Lieutenant Hornell was blinded and completely exhausted.
          He died shortly after being picked up.
        </p>
        <p className="history__text--citation">
          Flight Lieutenant Hornell had completed 60 operational missions,
          involving 600 hours’ flying. He well knew the danger and difficulties
          attending attacks on submarines. By pressing home a skilful and
          successful attack against fierce opposition, with his aircraft in a
          precarious condition, and by fortifying and encouraging his comrades
          in the subsequent ordeal, this officer displayed valour and devotion
          to duty of the highest order.”
