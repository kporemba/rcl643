        Malton veterans of World War 2 were not as slow as those of the First
        World War in organizing veterans service groups, but their reasons for
        uniting were the same as those of the Royal Canadian Legion's founders
        sixty years ago, in 1926.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        After the second world war, the veterans of Malton felt the need to
        unite for social contact and comradeship, as well as an urge to serve
        their community in peacetime. Thence, the Malton Veterans’ Association
        was formed in the late forties.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        After much struggle to hold the Association together, an application for
        a Branch Charter in the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
        League was accepted, and the charter granted. So it was that Branch 528
        Malton was born in the fall of 1951.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The first years as a branch of the Canadian Legion were an up-hill
        climb. Fora branch without a "home" there wasn't much to offer a fellow
        veteran except a membership card.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Community facilities and civic utilities in Malton at that time, were
        little better than those to be found in the boon-docks.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Social activities were limited to one or two a year. Old die-hard
        prohibitionists did little to promote a feeling of "good will" toward
        this new veterans’ organization now established within the community.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The lean years rolled by, with very little growth in membership and
        little broadening of activities. Not until Branch 528 gained a voice in
        municipal government through an incumbent president did they get a
        break. Public utilities and even paved streets and parking areas were
        installed at local recreational facilities. These improvements were the
        turning point in Branch 528's early life.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A big increase in social activities resulted, and membership in the
        Branch grew by leaps and bounds. As the community's growth continued, so
        did the Branch's.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Attempts were then begun to locate a suitable place to call home. During
        this time, efforts were increased to build up the Branch's prestige in
        the community through sponsorship of kids' hockey teams and Boy Scout
        groups. Relief provided for victims of Hurricane Hazel by the Branch did
        much to convince the citizens of Malton of the sincerity of the efforts
        of Branch 528 in its role as a service organization dedicated not only
        to its own members, but also to the community as a whole.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Meanwhile, funds were being built up for the day when the Branch might
        find a permanent home. The opportunity came in 1960 with the enlargement
        of Malton Airport and the offer for sale by the government of many
        nearby barracks buildings. One of these, the clubhouse of the Toronto
        Flying Club, which included a dancehall was procured, and Branch 528
        members never looked back.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Despite a mountain-size mortgage and only about a hundred willing hands,
        the Branch survived. In those early days it was considered to be the
        "poor country-cousin" by the other branches of District ‘D' Command.
        To-day, it is recognized as being second to none in the greater Toronto
        area.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The members of Branch 528 can be rightly proud of their standing in
        Ontario Provincial Command. They have made substantial contributions to
        Legion work in general, and to the community of Malton especially.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        For the past twenty years or more, Branch 528 has been a strong
        supporter of youth sports groups in the community as well as some
        outside Malton. It also donates thousands of dollars each year to
        various charitable foundations, including Legion housing projects
        operated for veterans and spouses by District ~D' Command.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The community of Malton has seen and felt the work done in the community
        by the different committees of Branch 528. Legion Memorial Gardens in
        Wildwood Park, with its beautiful cenotaph and mounted CF-100, is a
        landmark put there by hard working members of Branch 528 and certainly
        goes a long way in enhancing the beauty of Malton as well as creating a
        feeling of pride in the community itself. The students of Malton are
        also aware of the influence of Branch 528 through members’ work in youth
        education in support of school projects and presentations of bursaries.
        The efforts of the Branch's Youth Education Committee have uncovered
        much talent in the area schools, so much so that one student in the area
        recently won a Dominion award for the best Remembrance Day poster in its
        class.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Major contributions to the welfare of Malton and area residents have
        included the following: <br />- a new Station wagon donated to the
        Malton branch of the Canadian Cancer Society in 1980. <br />- $10,000 to
        the Etobicoke General Hospital in 1982 toward the purchase of a
        Computer-Assisted Tomographic (CAT) scanner. <br />- $6,000.00 to the
        Malton Community Council in 1984.

      <p className="branch__text">
        Truly, the members of Malton Branch 528 of the Royal Canadian Legion, in
        this their »35th year, can stand up with the rest of the branches across
        Canada in this, the Legion's Diamond Jubilee Year and proudly say,
        "Pride in Our Past--Faith in Our Future".

        A Tribute to the Malton Legion Ladies
      </h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The members of Malton Branch 528 would be remiss if they failed to
        mention their Ladies Auxiliary. Once the Branch had gained a permanent
        home, the ladies were not long in organizing themselves into one of the
        finest auxiliaries in the country. They obtained their charter on
        January 8, 1961.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Their untiring efforts over the past twenty-five years have brought many
        thousands of dollars to the coffers of Branch 528. Their excellent
        catering skills have drawn countless people to the banquet hall to
        celebrate weddings and anniversaries, and to attend dinner meetings and
        parties of a wide variety, boosting rentals of the facility almost to
        the limit. ever has so much been owed to so few.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Aside from their willingness to help the Branch at all times, these
        hard-working, generous girls also give their full share of support to
        the Provincial Command Ladies Auxiliary body each year.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">A Padre's Message</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The sixtieth anniversary year of the Royal Canadian Legion makes 1986 a
        singular historic year. It means that the Legion has grown in age--from
        its early years, through middle age, and now goes on!
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Legion proceeds now with a treasury of experience, good leadership,
        public understanding, and an energetic building programme throughout all
        Canada.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This rich heritage brings with it a responsibility--to serve needy
        veterans and their families. Because of our age, which the membership
        reflects, parades with banners flying and crowds applauding will become
        shorter in marching distance, and may even dwindle to a few in number in
        the next ten years.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Legion will have to measure its programmes for November 11th, and
        perhaps provide new formats for aging veterans. However, the Legion is
        relevant, and will adopt programmes and actions to continue to serve.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        There will always be the Royal Canadian Legion. And, the Act of
        Remembrance is our sacred trust.
