        Rangers Branch 213 - Our First Fifty-Five Years
      </h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Queens Rangers in Upper Canada a regiment formed by Lt. Col. John
        Grave Simcoe who was destined to become the first Lt. Governor of that
        Province.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Throughout the course of subsequent history the Rangers were to stand in
        the forefront of epic battles and receive many honours and decorations.
        An American General of the Revolutionary War had once remarked that the
        Queens Rangers was the most efficient single unit on either side. Praise
        from the enemy is praise indeed.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Rangers Branch 213 of the Royal Canadian Legion draw its name from this
        illustrious regiment.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">In The Beginning</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Almost every branch of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
        League developed from humble origins, Ranger Branch 213 is no exception.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The forerunner of the Canadian Legion was the Great War Veteran
        Association which had presence in Weston as early as 1919. Lacking
        permanent quarters this small group led an itineran existence until 1921
        when they acquired a small bungalow on Elsemere Avenue.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        It is an interesting side-note that in 1928 an independent group formed
        St. Alban Branch 118 with its headquarters in the 100 Building on Church
        Street. This Branch was fated to short life for in 1931 surrendered its
        charter and amalgamated with Ranger Branch 213 when the latter received
        its charter in November 1931. The Charter President was W. Matthew’s S.
        The transition from GMVA to the Canadian Legion and the amalgamation of
        the former St. Alban Branch with the newly formed Branch 213 in 1931
        created need for larger premises which were found over a garage on the
        other side of Elsemere. There we remained until 1949.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Moving Ahead</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The year between 1930 and 1931 were uneventful. The great depression was
        upon us money was hard to raise and growth was slow, but Legionnaires
        are fighters by nature and they persevered. Membership grew slowly
        reaching only about forty five but scarcely formidable force in 1939
        changed all that. The world exploded in cataclysm and Branch 213 alone
        with the Ladies Auxiliary responded as expected. The records show that
        the Weston Legion War Service Fund during 1940 - 1945 contributed over
        half a million cigarettes, 1,570 pairs of knitted socks and two hundred
        gift parcels to the 910 members of the armed services from Weston
        serving overseas.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The members of Rangers Branch 213 foresaw the flood of service men and
        women who would be returning to our midst and began to make plans to
        accommodate them. The great need was for funds to meet the cost of
        expansion.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        With entrepreneur business acumen they decided to invest in real estate
        by purchasing the property adjacent to the club premises. Every member
        made personal commitment and contributions regularly each month toward
        the cost of acquisition. Then the Ladies Auxiliary added nearly $600
        outside contributions provided sufficient funds to make the downpayment.
        Three years later the mortgage was burned in a special ceremony. The
        time had come to realize profit and proceed to the business of acquiring
        a new and more viable location.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Town of Weston came to the rescue in more way than one. First they
        donated a site at 14 Main Street and then further assisted in the
        project of financing, the Town also contributed $5,000 from a special
        “Armed Fore Fund” which had been earlier established. The new hall was
        appropriately name the “Legion Memorial Hall” Although it had human
        interest this rather momentous occasion the members contributed their
        own physical labour. The dedication ceremony was held May 6, 1949.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The trial and tribulation of the last eleven years were offset by
        success achieved in Branch activities such as street dances and raffles
        and by support from private donors. The tireless efforts ind labour and
        fund-raising by the Ladies Auxiliary also provided much needed support.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Changing Scene</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        As the sixties dawned burgeoning membership forces us to recognize that
        the time had come again to raise our sights and dream great dreams. We
        had reached yet another crossroads, another moment of truth. Our old
        building was not only inadequate but was located in a “dry area” which
        did nothing for the future success or even survival of the Branch.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        We thought about our immediate requirements but with the potential for
        further expansion in the future. We needed a location where a license
        would not be arbitrarily denied. We found a place at 4 Dennison Road
        East, a house and lot belonging to the Dennison estate.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        It is largely to Jack Burges that we owe a debt of gratitude for his
        entrepreneurial skill in negotiation to turn our dream into reality,
        Negotiations were opened in 1958 and later in June 1960 we moved in with
        full hearts and an empty treasury, n fact the branch purse had no funds
        to cover the cost of stocking the bar. This shortfall was personally
        bridged by Harry Clark. We were referring to our enterprise as “Phase I”
        How indomitable is the human spirit!
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The sixties proved to be time for real growth. In an eight year period
        Branch 213 was awarded Command Annual Six Percent Increase Award.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Midway through the decade the need for premise expansion was recognized.
        Phase Two was under way.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Contracts were left and second storey and the little ugly duckling that
        was our home was transformed into a prestigious edifice. On April 10,
        1965 the formal opening ceremonies took place benchmarking the history
        of Branch 213. Many distinguished guest, including civic officials,
        members of parliament and senior Legion officers were in attendance.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In recognition of the immense role played by the Ladies Auxiliary it was
        deemed appropriate that a special room be set aside for their uses. It
        is not exactly coincidental that this room is convenient to the kitchen.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Way We Grow</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Throughout the seventies and into the eighties growth continued apace
        under the guidance and leadership of a series of ever able president and
        senior executive offices and the precedent setting inauguration of our
        first lady president Peggy Hamilton who went on to serve in that office
        from 1971 to 1983. It is almost redundant to observe that the success of
        any organization depends finally on the acumen dedication and
        administrative skills of its executive officers. Branch 213 has been
        fortunate in this regard with a roster of able and responsible leaders.
        With pardonable pride we point to some Rangers Officers who have gone on
        to higher recognition:
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Ria Collins, Past Branch President who has served through Zone, District
        and Provincial offices and is Past president of Ontario Provincial
        Command.
        <br />
        Alex Dobson, Past Deputy Zone D-2 Commander
        <br />
        Jim Weir, Past Deputy Zone Commander
        <br />
        Gord Moore, Past Zone D2 Commander
        <br />
        Clare Wall, Provincial Service Bureau Officer
        <br />
        Tom Latus, District D Sports Officer
        <br />
        Mike Hamilton, Past Deputy Zone D-2 Commander
        <br />
        Ernie Halcrow, Deputy Zone D-2 Commander
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Rangers On Parade</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Pipe and Drum Band under Pipe Major Wally Eden A Trinkwo and Doug
        Stinson have performed in many parades and tournaments through Canada
        and the USA. The colour guard under the command of our present
        Sgt-At-Arms Bob Carsla and his predecessor have received accolades where
        it has appeared adding greatly to the reputation and prestige of Branch
        213.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Sporting Life</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Sports have traditionally played an important role in the varied
        activities of Ranger Branch. We have enjoyed many success over the years
        but win, lose or draw a sense of friendly competition has always
        prevailed.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Our sports officer over the years have contributed to the spirit of what
        good sportsmanship is all about. Tom Latus in this position since 1968
        has an enviable record. His first year in office was marked by the
        winning of the Ontario Provincial Cribbage Championship in Orillia. For
        over 10 years Ranger cribbage team have played in home in home series
        with Queen's Own Rifles Branch 344.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A Team from Rangers have competed in Provincial championship play in
        euchre, snooker and shuffleboard and have won Zone and District
        championships. It was Tom Latus who convened the euchrethon for five
        years which raised over $10,000 for Legion Village. These were grueling
        18 hour non-stop events, enough ties for the mettle of the most intrepid
        players. Ten pin bowling began eight years ago with a league of twenty
        players and now boasts 48 enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Darts is the ever popular mainstay of club activity. Horseshoes is a
        very popular activity. Hockey, baseball and broom ball are the other
        activities in which Branch 213 compete against other local teams.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Many of the men and women who hear the haunting drum roll march await
        rendezvous with destiny. Those who returned came back to a world forever
        changing even as they were forever changed. Then for a special elite who
        share camaraderie’s and esprit de corp that is totally exclusive and
        inestinguisagle. It is the copula that binds Legion members together.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Born out of the travail of war is the Royal Canadian Legion in
        nationwide fraternity of men and women dedicated to the service of the
        community - the well being of our former comrades in arms and their
        families and the preservation of the memory of those who died in the
        defense of Canada. The Legion epigraph translated from the Latin, says
        simply, "We will remember them!"
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text branch__text--poem">
        "Long quiet are the distant guns <br />
        Faint heard the bugle's cry <br />
        And muffled, roll the battle drums
        <br /> Beneath a silent sky."
      </p>
      <h1 className="branch__title">The Ladies of Branch 213</h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Our Ladies Auxiliary came into being with the granting of their charter
        on May 10, 1932.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The growth of the Auxiliary during the early years was not spectacular
        reaching only a scant two dozen by 1940 but their response to the
        outbreak of hostilities was typical of the result of a group of women.
        Reference has been made elsewhere to the volume of the contribution made
        to our young people of active service. Many of the resources to provide
        these comforts derive from the efforts of the Ladies Auxiliary who
        raised the funds through bingo games, weekly luncheons, draws, bazaars,
        dances and other special events including monthly games sponsored by the
        "Euchre Group" held in the members’ homes.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In concert with Auxiliaries from other branches our ladies also took
        their their turn serving the Transit Bureau at Union Station where they
        assisted, advised and provided small comfort to the troops passing
        through and greeted those who were returning from overseas.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        With the coming of peace the Auxiliary found itself deeply involved in
        fund raising to help with the expense of relocating the Branch and the
        attendance increased cost of operation. To do this they began acting to
        service clubs and other associations as well as private social events
        and weddings while continuing with the Saturday night bingos. When in
        June 1960 we moved to Dennison Avenue it was the Auxiliary that provided
        the funds to equip the kitchen with the major appliances and covered
        other capital costs.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        As in every organization their is always an on-going ebb and flow in
        membership through illness, retirement, transfer and other
        uncontrollable factors. From time to time the Auxiliary has feelen
        victim to these eventualities and it is tribute to their indefatigable
        spirit that the group continues to be vital and enduring unit of the
        Legion.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A tribute to Olive Mattison, 42 year member of the Branch 213 Ladies
        Auxiliary who served eleven years as President of the Auxiliary. She
        held no fewer than six Legion medals including the highest award for
        meritorious service from Dominion Command and a Certificate of
        Appreciation from Ontario Command. Miss Mattison a native of Weston,
        passed away in December 1982, in her 83rd year.
