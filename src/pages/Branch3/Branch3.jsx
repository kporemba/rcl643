        Sir Winston Spencer Churchill Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion
      </h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League was instituted
        in Winnipeg Manitoba- in the year 1926 In the following year - 1927
        fifteen veterans of the New Toronto applied for and received a charter
        to be known as Lakeshore Ontario No. 3 Branch of the Canadian Legion -
        B.E.S.L.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The charter members were Percy Flint, Sidney Wilmott, William Lomas,
        Thomas Derry, Authur Rigby, Robert Armour, Ralph , George Moore Jr.,
        Sydney Finch, Arthur Fletcher, James Yuili, Sr. Magnuo Armour, Daniel
        Smyth, Joseph Nuni and Roy Lush. Through their own efforts and that held
        their association of the time, they saw that guidelines that have
        enabled us to go from strength to strength over the past 58 years.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The first home of Branch 3 was sometimes termed as a storeroom over
        Heathcote Hardware situation on the north side of Lakeshore road between
        Fifteenth and Sixteenth Streets. In this small room they helped needy
        veterans in the area who had served in the Boer War and First World War
        - and the widows and families of those who had perished as a result of
        their service in conflicts.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        After spending four years in the above premises in 193_ Branch 3 moved
        to the old Orange Hall on Tenth Street. The renovations on the outside
        and inside were accomplished through the efforts of the members to make
        the hall a more suitable meeting place, where Legion activities could
        also be expanded to accommodate the increasing membership.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1935, once again Branch 3 moved - this time to Sandford Barn located
        on the laneway south of Lakeshore Road between Eight and Ninth Streets.
        This building was also refurbished by the members. It was no small task
        converting a barn where horses had been kept to a suitable meeting place
        for the ever increasing membership.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The biggest event in the history of Branch 3 to that date happened in
        1941 when the membership voted at a general meeting to purchase a
        building on Seventh Street north of Birmingham Street. That building has
        been built by Browns Brass which later became Anaconda American Brass
        and is now Arrowhead Metals Limited, The building had been built-in as a
        rooming house for the employees of Brown Brass in 192_, the building was
        purchased by Mowhawk Radio who turned it into a radio factory.

      <p className="branch__text">
        On December 29, 1941 permission was granted by Dominion Command to
        rename our Branch after Britain’s wartime prime minister and the branch
        became known as Winston Spencer Churchill Branch 3 of the Canadian
        Legion - B,E.S.L.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        During the war years the Branch was very active. The Branch executive
        and members organized and held entertainment nights in the Capitol
        theater on the corner of Fourth Street and Lakeshore Road. The monies
        raised from these Sunday night events was used to send cigarettes and
        comforts to men and women from New Toronto serving in the Armed Forces.
        After VE Day and VJ Day in 1945 and into 1946, Comrade Fred Barrett,
        member of the Branch executive met every troop train arriving at the CNE
        grounds to welcome the returning veterans and arrange for their
        transportation homeward. The Branch also arranged the transportation of
        their own members and families to go to meet their returning loved ones.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1953, when Churchill was knighted, Branch 3 immediately applied for
        and was granted permission to change our name this time to Sir Winston
        Spencer Churchill Branch 3.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1958 by order-in -council, Dominion Command passed a resolution that
        the British Empire Service League be dropped and that all branches be
        known as “The Canadian Legion “.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1961 “Royal was added but and became known as “The Royal Canadian
        Legion: the name we use today.

        After 2_ years of operation on 26_ Seventh Street the need for repair
        was becoming more essential and the need for better facilities for the
        swelling membership. It was regularly passed at a general meeting that
        we would build a new hall immediately to the north on an adjoining
        property that had been purchased with forsightedness a_few years
        earlier.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This spanking new Legion hall was officially opened in 1963 with a
        number of well known dignitaries present in the modern banquet room.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        On February 25, 1977, Branch 3 celebrated their 50th anniversary at a
        banquet with Provincial President David Capperauld as guest speaker. The
        evening concluded with dancing.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1975 a couple of year earlier we had been informed by Metropolitan
        Toronto that we were being expropriated to make way for the southward
        extension of Islington Avenue. This forced the Branch into purchasing
        property and building a new home at 15 Eight Street, a block or so to
        the southwest. Ultimately in July 1978 the doors were opened to the
        membership. The official opening of the new premises that we occupy
        today was held on February 24, 1979 with the Dominion President as a
        guest speaker at the ceremony and banquet.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Looking to the future Branch 3 should be here for many years to come
        enabling us to carry on with the aims and objects laid down by our
        Comrades who first started Branch 3 in 1927. We are well known in the
        community for helping veterans and their windows and families, for
        supporting community sports and senior citizen groups and for providing
        bursaries in the educational fields. As time marches on Branch 3 will be
        ever striving to serve the community on an even greater scale.{" "}

      <p className="branch__text">
        The Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 3 received its original charter on
        January 13, 1947 but little of their early activities have been
        recorded. In 1960 however the ladies elected Mary Fleming as their
        president for the year 1960 and 1961. Later in 1978 Mary joined James
        Clark in turning the soil for the new building on Eighth Street.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        On March 5, 1971 the charter was re-constituted and established as Sir
        Winston Spencer Churchill (Ontario No. 3) Branch of the Ladies
