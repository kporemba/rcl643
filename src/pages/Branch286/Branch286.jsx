        Coronation Branch 286 Of The Royal Canadian Legion
      </h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        On November 11, 1918 at the close of the Great World War it was time to
        go home for the thousands of Canadians service their country in faraway
        places.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Shortly after their return a national organization was formed known as
        the Great War Veterans Association. This organization along with others
        was founded to provide assistance in meeting the needs of veterans and
        their families.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1926, the GWVA, the Canadian Legion, and the British Empire Service
        League merged into a new group named the Canadian Legion of the British
        Empire Service League. A charter in this organization was granted to
        Coronation Branch 286 on April 2, 1937. On April 5, 1939 a charter was
        received by the Ladies Auxiliary.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Under the leadership of Padre R. Davidson, charter president of the new
        branch the first executive was formed and the tough paths ahead were
        laid down for consideration.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        To begin with executive meetings were held in private homes of members
        and a 5 cent levy per member was paid to the homeowner. One of the first
        decisions made was with regard to membership dues, which were decided as
        follows: “Annual membership fee to be $2 per annum and in the event that
        a member be in dire straights, payment would be accepted at 50 cents
        quarterly.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The property on which the Branch now stands was donated by Mr. Bert
        Irwin, a prominent member of the community on Irwin Road on which the
        Branch is located, was named after him. Donation of the land enabled the
        executive to plan construction of the original building of Branch 286
        with a small but dedicated membership, constructed went ahead with
        donated materials and voluntary labour, a way in which most Legion
        Branches began operations. The first premises to be constructed
        consisted of a single story facility, which from 1942 to 1949 was also
        used by the local Board of Education during daytime hours as a school.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A volunteer firehall was located on the northwest corner of the property
        on Invin Road, which served as a temporary home for special and
        executive meetings until such time at the new facility was opened and
        dedicated by the Branch.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        As membership increased in the year that followed and new Legion
        comrades expressed a desire to participate actively, stand for office,
        and become leaders in furthering the aims and objects of the
        organization, plans for improvement and extension of the hall were
        initiated.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Thence from that single story premises on the original 2 acre property
        we now enjoy a facility that includes a banquet and assembly hall that
        accommodates up to 200 people, a dining room run by the Ladies
        Auxiliary, a lounge with full bar, a downstairs bar and lounge and a
        fully equipped clubroom.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Plans for the future include further extension of Irwin Hall with a view
        to increasing banquet accommodations and providing a new cloakroom and
        storage areas and a wheelchair access to washrooms.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Over the years the service bureau of Branch 286 has been fully
        supportive not only of veteran members, but also in compliance with
        Royal Legion dictates of non members with veteran status in times of
        need. A representative of the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs
        visits the branch on the first Wednesday of the month to listen and
        offer guidance to any veteran requiring assistance.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Beside caring for personal needs, we arrange for hospitalized veterans
        to visit the Branch for various social functions and entertainment. The
        committee responsible for these activities also runs bingo evenings at
        Sunnybrook Hospital on a regular schedule, so that those unable to
        attend our functions the Branch still receive our care and attention.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Legion’s involvement in community affairs and its support of senior
        citizens groups is far reaching throughout Metro Toronto and district
        and not confined to our own immediate area. Over the years money has
        been donated to Metro Toronto Legion Village, Metro Toronto Finchurst
        Legion Homes, Etobicoke Seniors Homes in Rexdale and Etobicoke Parks and
        Recreation for seniors, also the St. John Ambulance, the Cancer Fund,
        Woodstock and Barrie Disaster Funds, Hospital for Sick Children,
        Etobicoke General Hospital, Salvation Army, Arthritis Society, World
        Vision Organization, War Amps, Annual Metro Toronto Police Games and the
        Canadian National Games.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Junior activities also receive donations such as the Etobicoke
        Swim-A-Thon, Rexdale Soccer, bowling, baseball, softball, hockey,
        scouts, boxing and the Navy and Air Force cadets, and our banquet hall
        has been made available for all sorts of local youth functions at no
        charge.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Another important part of our community support is that afforded to the
        eight high schools in the area. Bursaries and other scholastic awards
        are put forward annually to encourage recipients to further their
        education and commit themselves to involvement in business and
        vocational training. Donations to community projects from Branch 286
        from 1980 through 1985, have totalled $81,088.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Students within Branch 286 poppy area are invited annually to compete
        for Legion awards in the essay, poem, posters and public speaking
        competitions. The elementary and secondary have proved to be very
        supporting in encouraging their students to take active part in this,
        our Youth Education Program.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        On parade, Branch 286 has always been strong in turnout, and has been
        well led by its presidents, pipe band and colour parties. Unfortunately
        in recent years our own band has folded and we have had to seek the
        support of others to lead us when needed. This has proved successful and
        with a full colour party we have been able to compete with the best in
        Toronto Zone D! Command. Annual parades include Warriors Day at the CNE,
        our annual D-Day service at Sanctuary Park and the Branch‘s Remembrance
        Service held each year during Legion Week and on November 11 - the
        national day of Remembrance.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Brigade 286 of the Order of the St. John Ambulance accompany us on most
        parades. They are the first St. John Brigade in Canada to be sponsored
        by a branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. They bear the number of our
        Branch 286.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Branch sports activities have been expanded over the years to include
        not only indoor sports but also outdoor sports.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Bowling league teams have been competing since 1951 and curling since
        1958 both continue to thrive. Indoor activities include darts,
        shuffleboard, snooker, euchre and cribbage and in summer there’s our
        golf tournaments and fun days.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Awards won in various events at the Zone, District and Provincial levels
        are on display in the Branch’s clubrooms.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Entertainment in the Branch has seen many changes in our 42 years of
        operation, but with awareness for the need to enjoy celebrative times
        together, the opportunity to do so has never been overlooked. For
        instance, the first Branch picnic in 1938 involved a boat trip to Port
        Dalhousie at a return fare of 20 cents.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Although prices since then have increased dramatically, out annual New
        Years Eve dances, Monte Carlo Nights, corn roasts and ham and turkey
        rolls continue to receive full support.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The children are not forgotten either. Over the years their introduction
        to an inclusion in Legion events should be a memorial held dear to them,
        summer picnics, Christmas parties, Warriors Day Parades at the CNE and
        the visits from Santa Clause at Christmas- time.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Bingo commenced in 1937 and continues to this day. It attracts not only
        members of the branch, but also the local community who have always been
        made welcome.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In this the Diamond Jubilee of the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 286 has
        been strong in support of the 60th anniversary celebrations. The special
        tulips imported from Holland, a special strain, blood red in colour and
        plated last fall will have bloomed by now as a symbol of our Remembrance
        of Them. Ceremonies and celebrations are not over yet - much is planned
        to round our commemorative year.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        To forget the service given by the Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 286 during
        our years of struggle would be remissful. To begin with their strength
        in numbers was scant, but their response at the outbreak of the Second
        World War was typical of a determined group of women to help in a time
        of need. They raised funds in conjunction with other branches to assist
        and supply comfort to troops overseas. Their efforts after hostilities
        were devoted to raising funds for the improvements of the Branch’s
        facilities and to the introduction of catering to social and private
        events. Our ladies continue to uphold the aims and objects of the Royal
        Canadian Legion and hope to receive help from younger members now
        joining the ranks. It is a tribute to the Ladies Auxiliary and their
        indefatigable spirit that the group continues to be a vital and enduring
        unit of the Branch.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        We continue strong in our endeavor and with Pride in our Past, Faith in
        our Future - we will dedicate ourselves with fervor to all future
        commitments.
