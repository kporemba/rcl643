      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Early Years</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Etobicoke Branch 210 of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire League
        was granted its charter on August 12, 1931. In those days meeting halls,
        like many other facilities, were in short supply, with the result that
        the Branch's monthly meetings were held in private homes until a room
        was finally found in the Islington Public School on Cordova Road.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        As membership grew, the need for more suitable quarters became evident,
        and a new home was found at the corner of Bloor and Islington in "Mrs.
        Dyer's Store". This was really just an oversize room, but it filled the
        bill as a place to hold social events and membership business meetings.
        The year was still 1931.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        These were the days of the "depression" and, almost equally depressing,
        "prohibition". Fund-raising was difficult in the extreme, and red ink
        often appeared on the Branch's bank statement, but the members were
        survivors by nature, and their perseverance ultimately prevailed. Card
        games, dances, monthly draws and "good cheer" raffles provided the main
        revenue for the fledgling organization.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Turning the Corner</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        At this point, Col. J.E.L. Streight appeared on the scene. A veteran
        officer of the Boer War and the First World War, the colonel perceived
        the plight of the Legionnaires, who still were lacking a permanent home.
        He offered them, at modest rent, a building on Bloor Street just west of
        Islington Avenue, then known as Ryan's Barbeque and Dance Hall. This
        building was located on what is now the east parking lot of our present
        property. In 1933 we moved in, and_there we remained until 1944.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">A Time of Transition</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Second World War, which exploded upon us in 1939 and continued
        inabated for six years, saw thousands of young men and women gathered to
        the Armed Forces. Our need was starkly clear --larger premises to
        accommodate the flood of veterans who would be returning to our midst.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Early in 1943, largely through the efforts of then branch president,
        William McKenzie, a plan was conceived to erect a new building that
        would be large enough to meet our foreseeable needs and prestigious
        enough to befit our growing municipality, and to serve as a tribute to
        those who had served and as a memorial to those who inevitably would not
        return.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A committee was formed to approach Col. Streight with a proposal to
        purchase the property. It was hoped that an arrangement would be agreed
        upon whereby the Branch could embark on the immense task of assembling
        the necessary to funding for a new building. The colonel was so generous
        in his terms that it seemed only fitting to re-name the Branch in his
        honour. And so it was that we became Col. J.E.L. Streight Branch 210 of
        the Canadian Legion--B.E.S.L., after the appropriate changes had been
        made to our charter. But, we still had no building!
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Under the leadership of Comrade McKenzie and the good offices of Cyrus
        B. Payne and other early members, an initial amount of $20,000 was
        subscribed to cover preliminary costs. To raise the balance of funds
        needed, it was again Col. Streight who came to the rescue in a unique
        way. He provided funds to construct a bungalow on Dundas Street, to be
        put up as the winning prize in a gigantic raffle. The house became known
        as "Victory Villa", and thousands of raffle tickets were sold world-wide
        at $1.00 each. It is comforting to recall that, when the lucky ticket
        was drawn at a huge picnic and rally at Central Park, the winner was a
        young soldier serving at the time in Germany.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        With funds in hand, the original $20,000 of interim financing was
        retired, and construction was begun of the present building designed by
        architects Hanks and Erwin and completed by general contractor James
        Seeback. The new building was officially dedicated, free of debt, on
        Sunday, December 16, 1945.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">After V-J Day</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Membership continued to grow in the immediate post-war period, and with
        growth came gradual change.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1949, Charles D. Hardy was the first WW-II veteran to be elected
        president of the Branch. Under his leadership, veterans of both wars
        became united on the executive council to begin building a solid future
        for the Branch. We were at last off and running.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        But we had not run far when in 1950 a fire broke out in the lower
        clubrooms. In retrospect, this might now be viewed as a blessing in
        disguise for, in the ensuing years, major modifications and improvements
        resulted, including installation of a new bar, a soundproof
        drop-ceiling, new furniture and carpeting.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This was a time also when new community projects were undertaken. The
        Branch became involved with the Kingsway Youth Baseball League, the West
        Mall Hockey Association and other youth-oriented programs and
        activities. These programs and several others are still among Branch
        210's ongoing community projects.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        To digress for a moment, on the 35th anniversary of the Canadian Legion
        in 1960, the Queen gave her consent for the Legion to affix the " Royal"
        before its name. The national organization was then officially re-named
        the Royal Canadian Legion.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        During the early 1960's, development of our fine auditorium was eee ot:
        snes Coach Light Room, this facility has proven to be a boon, not only
        to Br rae Me aie the community as a whole. An elevator was installed to
        facilitate the work of the Ladies Auxiliary, that indefatigable group of
        dedicated women to whom we owe so much.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Perils of Progress</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        November 15, 1966, was a red-letter day in the history of the Branch. By
        aa post we were advised that part of our lands were to be expropriated
        by Metro she and the Toronto Transit Commission as a result of the
        inexorable westward pee the subway. We were to lose some 12,000 square
        feet of land, the equivalent of forty parking spaces. It was time to
        fight, again!
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The ensuing battle was classic. But, when the smoke had cleared, the
        negotiators won more land than they had surrendered, and the
        expropriating authorities picked up the tab, which was sizable.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Almost a decade of serenity followed until, on Good Friday, 1975, a
        truly serious blaze erupted , which caused heavy fire damage to the roof
        and upper floors of the building, and water damage to the lower areas.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Once more the fight-back spirit prevailed, and by mid-summer Branch 210
        had been restored "ship-shape and Bristol-fashion".
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Uxorious Years</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The "seventies" were marked by extraordinary and profound changes in the
        Legion organization. Long the bastion of male chauvinism, the Branch,
        which had successfully fought financial struggles, fires, floods, legal
        battles, politicians and the Establishment, fell before the subtle
        blandishments of the fair sex. The ancient shibboleths of masculine
        suzerainty disappeared. The "no females" tule passed into history. Ex-
        service women were granted full membership privileges.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Other major changes have since been implemented, including broadening of
        the Associate class of membership to accept sons and daughters of
        ex-service personnel, with full voting privileges and the right to hold
        office.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Looking Forward</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This year, as we observe the Diamond Jubilee of the Royal Canadian
        Legion, we are proud that Branch 210 is not only flourishing, but is
        also planning further expansion in new premises. Construction is
        expected to gel underway by the Shipp Corporation in the near future.
        The new building will be located immediately to the west of our present
        site and will be totally modern in every respect. Floor area will be
        about doubled and parking facilities greatly expanded.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">And Finally</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Our history is rich in colour and content. If we have heroes, they are
        those who serve in the front line of Legion and those who have done so
        in the past. Our Branch is the lengthening shadow of all who have gone
        before. Unfortunately, a roll-call of the men and women to whom we are
        collectively indebted is not possible here. Nor is a detailed
        chronological recitation of events. We have touched only the highlights.
      </p>
      <h1 className="branch__title">On The Distaff Side of Branch 210</h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The late Joseph Conrad wrote..."Being a woman is a terribly difficult
        task, since it consists principally in dealing with men". The Ladies
        Auxiliary of Col J.E.L. Streight Branch 210 have met this challenge and
        won the day.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        It was in 1931, the year of the Branch's founding, that the Ladies
        Auxiliary of the Branch was formed under the presidency of Ethel Ide,
        who served in that office until 1935.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        As Legion members on the uxorial side, they have made much more than a
        token contribution to the Branch during their 55-year existence. Their
        motto is "Service" and they have abundantly fulfilled that mandate.
        Their largesse, their dedication and their untiring efforts are
        boundless. As visitors to the sick and aging, as sponsors of fetes and
        parties for the benefit of the disadvantaged, and as donors of bursaries
        and charitable grants, their ongoing sense of duty to the community
        marks their dedication. We appreciate them! We honour them! We salute
        them!
      </p>
      <h1 className="branch__title">Years of Remembrance</h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Fifty-five years have come and gone since the founding of Legion Branch
        210. In that time members have never forgotten "the fallen". No monthly
        meeting is ever opened without the "Silent Tribute" that marks our
        community of spirit with those who died on foreign soil.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Each November, the Branch invites all citizens to join them in a
        ceremony of Remembrance.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In the early years, these events were marked by parades to various
        churches, and subsequently to a memorial cross erected in Central Park.
        Now, the service is held at the cenotaph at Etobicoke's civic centre.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This remarkable structure rises eighty feet and is embossed with a
        60-foot silver cross. It stands as a credit to Branch 210 and to the
        municipal council of the day. In an historic ceremony the cenotaph was
        formally dedicated on Nov. 3, 1968, coincident with the 50th anniversary
        of Armistice Day. It is probably the tallest war memorial in the land,
        apart from the Peace Tower in Ottawa.
