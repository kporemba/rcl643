      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Early Years</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Mimico - Humber Bay Branch 217 of the Canadian Legion of the British
        Empire Service League received its charter on January 8, 1932. Comrade
        Fred Wiltshire presided over the Branch or Post as we were known in
        those days, during the formative years of 1932 and 1933 Branch 217 was
        in fact a splinter ground from Lakeshore Branch e a move that transpired
        when veterans in the Humber Bay Mimico area realized that they might be
        better served through having an identity of their own.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        During the “hungry thirties” hardship was rampant because of the great
        depression and many veterans of the Great World War were hard pressed
        financially. A group of veterans from that area had set about in 1930 to
        obtain membership in the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
        League the name of the national organization of the time. After
        obtaining their charter, their first meetings were held in private homes
        until use was gained of St. Andrews Hall on Church Street and Royal York
        Road.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Shortly thereafter improved space was found on the second floor of the
        “piano factory” on Royal York Road and Newcastle Street.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Early in 1933, yet another move was made, this time to Bailey House on
        “the hill” located just west of Park Lawn Avenue on the street now named
        Legion Road. The house was formerly owned by Sir Henry Pellatt of Casa
        Loma fame. Rent was $1.00 per year payable to the Township of Etobicoke.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Tales are still told of the good times had on the hill - dancing under
        the stars on Saturday nights to Wally Bromby’s orchestra on the open air
        floor built by the members, of the corn roasts, the card parties and the
        picnics. Admission for some functions was 25 cents - which included
        sandwiches prepared by the Ladies Auxiliary and a quart of beer,
        bootlegged of course.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        It was in November 1033 that the first memorial supper was held in
        Connaught Hall on Mimico Avenue. This memorable event grew into an
        annual supper known as “The Old Sweats Dinner” in honour of the Great
        War veterans from the surrounding district.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        During this period many interesting articles of the happenings of the
        Branch were submitted to The Lakeshore Advertiser, and other media.
        These clippings are preserved in a book and bring back many memories not
        only of the Legion but of the local community as well.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Those were the depression years and only the great efforts and zeal of
        the members left, but their presidents and executive bodies led to
        survival of the Branch and eventual prosperity. There was very little
        cash to be had, and from 193_ to 193_ the presidents and their
        committees were hard pressed to finance the efforts and projects. To
        their everlasting credit they did succeed and Branch 217 did survive and
        flourish where many others failed because of financial or other
        problems.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">The Second World War and Afterwards</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1938 we moved to a house on Drummond Street at the time when clouds
        were gathering over Europe. Undaunted though, the members made plans to
        construct a new meeting hall on a lot next to the house. Many problems
        were encountered with shortage of materials and tradesmen and other
        obstacles. But these were eventually overcome and in 1951 a new building
        was completed. It was named The David Hornell Memorial Hall in honour of
        the Mimico man who was the first officer of the RCAF to be awarded
        (posthumously) the Victoria Cross.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Many members will be remembered for their contribution to the new hall
        on Drummond Street and to the veterans cause and the community. One well
        remembered is Comrade Charlie Ring a veteran of the Spanish American War
        who fought with Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders. Comrade Ring was wounded
        at San Juan Hill in Texas. Later he moved to Mimico became a Canadian
        citizen and joined Branch 217. He is well remembered for his valuable
        aid in the construction of the new hall and for his many other projects
        in the Legion and the community.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        During the second World War Branch 217 was kept busy with efforts to
        help shorten the conflict. Men and women from the are who volunteered
        for active service were remembered by parcels from the Branch. Many of
        those who returned became members of the Branch to carry on the
        traditions of the Legion.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Later in 1951 a disastrous fire gutted the recently opened building on
        Drummond Street. Many records and much memorabilia were destroyed. After
        the Drummond Street building had been gutted the decision was made to
        purchase the building we now own on Royal York Road and negotiations
        were entered into with the owner, William Morrisey. The building in
        itself had a very interesting and historical background being the old
        Edward Stock homestead. The Stock family were early pioneers in the area
        and had erected this home in 1887 when the surrounding area was
        farmland.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        When negotiations were completed and the Branch moved into the new
        quarters there were many things to be done to prepare the building for
        Meetings and social functions. A member was contracted to add on what is
        now the main hall - this was completed in 1954 and was following by a
        strong of other renovations.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The downstairs club room was completed in 1961 and during this time
        became known as the Royal Canadian Legion instead of the Canadian
        Legion--B.E.S.L.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1966 when the Town of Mimico was incorporated into the Borough of
        Etobicoke, the town colours were presented to the Branch for safe
        keeping.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Other renovations to the building included the addition of a ladies
        lounge, a new front entrance, extensive revision of the plumbing and
        heating and a new bar and kitchen on the second floor in the period from
        1968 to 1973.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1983 another major renovation was completed with the combining of the
        ladies lounge and the men’s clubroom into one opening and one 3 foot
        wall that separated the two.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">An Epilogue</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Over the years the spiritual guidance of the Branch has been well
        serviced by Rev. W. Watt, Rev. R. A. Wigby and now Rev. Keith Kiddell.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        “We will remember them is part of the Royal Canadian Legion’s pledge and
        Branch 217 has exhibited this in many ways, one of these being a very
        active Poppy Committee. Over the years this committee has raised funds
        through the sale of poppies to alleviate the stress and hardship
        suffered by the less fortunate of our veterans and their families.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In its 54 year history through good times and lean, peace and war,
        Branch 217 has always been in the foreground of the community and of
        veterans and Legion activities. Sponsorship of hockey, ball, lacrosse
        and other team sports for the youth, the awarding of bursaries to
        deserving students, help for our members down on their luck, assistance
        to Red Cross blood donor clinics and outings for our senior citizens,
        are but a few of the many commendable endeavors undertaken by the
        members.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        This is but a brief account of a proud Branch of The Royal Canadian
        Legion whose members now join comrades across Canada in celebrating
        their Jubilee year. The value of the Branch to veterans and to the
        community in difficult times for who can estimate the intangible spirit
        of co-operation that has been the backbone of the Branch through the
        years. For fifty four years - Mimico Humber Bay Branch 217 has been in
        the forefront with other larger and possibly more affluent branches.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        We have tried to record here some of the good times along with the bad.
        May the Branch and the Legion celebrate many more birthdays in the years
        ahead.

      <h1 className="branch__title">The Ladies of Branch 217</h1>

      <p className="branch__text">
        The history of the Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 217 in a large way
        paralleled that of the Branch. Although the Auxiliary and the Branch
        have together suffered many frustrations, a great number of joint
        efforts have been brought to a happy conclusion through the generous
        co-operation of both arms of the Branch.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        When Frances Lomax and her colleagues held their early meeting to
        prepare an application for a charter from Dominion Command, conditions
        were much different that they are today. The memory of the First World
        War was still fresh in the minds of the people. The suffering of the
        wounded who had returned home, the hardships of the widows and families
        of those who would never return and the deprivation caused by the great
        depression weight heavily on the shoulders of every one. However, this
        band of courageous ladies undertook to form an auxiliary arm of the
        still unchartered Mimico- Humber Bay Branch of the Canadian Legion. They
        were indeed very jubilant when their charter was granted on the same
        date as that of the Branch, January 8, 1932.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A special project of the Ladies Auxiliary is the bursary grants program.
        These grants are to veterans children who may need financial assistance
        to further their education. Funds for a special project of the Ladies
        Auxiliary is the bursary grants program. These grants are to veterans
        children who may need financial assistance to further their education.
        Funds for this and other projects have been raised_through such
        endeavors as annual bazaars, rummage sales and bake sales.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        In 1963 the first Ladies Concert was produced under the direction of
        Molly Dixon. These shows have become a tradition with Branch 217 and
        have been enjoyed by many people both at the Branch and at outside
        locations. In later years the show has been under the capable direction
        of Doreen Strader and Marion Boyd. The enthusiasm of all who take part
        marks the enthusiasm of all members of the Auxiliary in general.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        One of the senior ladies, in age, but not in effort is Lil Redding, who
        joined the Ladies Auxiliary in 1933 and was initiated in January of that
        year by President Lomas in the old Mimico Town Hall, which was then the
        Methodist Church on Church Street. The Ladies held their meetings in the
        church and later at the old Beech House and Lil tells us that the | dues
        were ten cents a month.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Many happy meetings were held in private homes where quilting bees,
        sewing parties, both social and card parties were held and many pleasant
        evenings can be recalled by the older members.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Another community effort of the ladies has been their aid to the
        Salvation Army for many years in canvassing the homes in the area for
        funds.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        May this dedication that has been so greatly exhibited in the past fifty
        four years be carried through the next half century.
