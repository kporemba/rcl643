        While researching background material of the Branch, we came across
        transcripts of early interviews with three of our “old sweats” from the
        First World Ward - Tommy Bonner, George James, and Bill Gornell (now
        deceased).
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Rather than rewriting history, we felt that the following excerpt from
        their interviews would make for an interesting insightful and
        informative account of 266’s early years. We hope you will agree:

          “Now here is some of the history our Legion Branch 266. It was started
          as an independent club, with a committee of six veterans in the late
          twenties. The first president was Charles Jackson who worked at the
          CPO. Comrade Jackson was interested in veterans activities and had
          asked me and five more veterans if we were interested in starting our
          own club. Eventually the six of us gave Charles permission to apply
          for a charter, which was granted on October 4, 1934.”

          some repairs amongst our little group. A veteran named Bob Johnson had

          thought of another way to make money. I would go to a small store on

          the "upstairs of the old Fire Hall Ernie Woods as there was not enough
          room in our premises. The prizes were groceries and this helped us to
          raise a little money every three weeks towards a new building as well

        After gaining their charter on April 17, 1942 they held card games in
        each others homes every week to raise money for the equipment needed to
        furnish a kitchen in the Branch Hall and also to buy wool to knit for
        the army. They campaigned with the men on poppy days and worked hard at
        veterans functions. During the war many of the ladies went down to Union
        Station to meet the soldiers and help check their bags and give them
        meal tickets if they were waiting to meet other trains.

        The ladies often visited Park View Lodge where there were always quite a

        They were always pleased to see the Ladies Auxiliary and receive their
        goodies and a little cash. The ladies also formed a kitchen band and
        went to different clubs and played old-time songs, which everyone
        enjoyed greatly.
