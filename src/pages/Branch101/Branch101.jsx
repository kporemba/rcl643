        Long Branch Branch 101 of the Royal Canadian Legion

      <p className="branch__text">
        Chartered in June 1927, Long Branch Branch 101 of the Canadian Legion of
        the British Empire Service League quickly established itself as a
        leading component of the local scene. In the ensuing 59 years,
        membership grew from 16 original charter members to the point now where
        Branch 101 boasts a roll-call in excess of 1100.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Many of the older types are still quite involved in Branch activities,
        and display at least as much energy, or more, as some of the young ones
        do.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Regrettably, none of the charter members remain with us today. But Ed
        Haylock, whose father, Joseph Edward, was a veteran of the South African
        campaign at the turn of the century, and whose uncle Tom was wounded and
        gassed in the Great World War, still visits the Branch regularly.

      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Early and Present Quarters</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The first Branch-owned premises was a house "out in the woods" on
        Thirty-Fifth Street, which unfortunately was destroyed by fire in 1937.
        However, it was replaced shortly afterwards by a larger hall constructed
        next door, with much of the labour volunteered by Branch members and
        their friends to help minimize costs.

      <p className="branch__text">
        The main structure of the present building, erected at 3850 Lakeshore
        Boulevard West in co-operation with the incumbent reeve, Marie Curtis,
        and local builders, craftsmen, suppliers and merchants, was formally
        opened on May 24, 1958. It was subsequently enlarged considerably and
        re-dedicated in June 1967.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Community Involvement</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        From its inception 59 years ago, the Branch has been active in the
        community, through provision of financial assistance to local hospitals,
        church organizations, scouts and guides, and sports groups. Local
        students have benefited from our annual public speaking, literary and
        poster contests sponsored under the Branch's youth education program,
        and from a university —scholar-ship established by the Ladies Auxiliary
        in ho

      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Some Notable Members</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Although not an original charter member, Harry Staughton became a highly
        respected president of the Branch. Our Quiet Room is named after that
        fine gentleman. Tastefully furnished in March 1962 by the Ladies
        Auxiliary, this room bears testimony to the indebtedness of the Branch
        to Harry, one of its three recipients of the Legion Meritorious Service
        Medal, the highest award that Dominion Command confers ona member. The
        others have been Reta McCrindle (deceased) and Bruce Robertson. Harry's
        LMSM also bore the Palm Leaf in recognition of his outstanding service
        to the community.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Earlier, in 1950, Harry had been made a life member, and on November 12,
        1981, he was presented with a watch and fob by the Branch to celebrate
        his 90th birthday, accompanied by a congratulatory message from Her
        Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        George Thistle, a past Branch President now living in Orillia, remembers
        hell on earth as a combatant with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in
        three of the big battles in Europe during the Great War.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Dave Robb remains reticent about his winning of the Distinguished Flying
        Cross and the Air Force Cross during RCAF sorties over Europe as leader
        of a Lancaster bomber squadron during the Second World War.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Bruce Robertson, who flew 100 operations on armed reconnaissance and
        convoy escort missions with the RCAF in PBY Catalina flying boats in the
        Burmese campaign, remembers the good times with Len Birchall, his
        commanding officer for a time.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        And Don (Fergie) Ferguson, one of our congenial bar stewards since 1980,
        would prefer to speak of his father-in-law, Fred Shaw, a charter member
        of the Branch and one of the early police chiefs of Long Branch, than to
        think of his 15 missions with the RCAF over occupied Europe as a
        rear-gunner in ZLQ "Queenie", a Canadian-built Lancaster bomber.
      </p>
      <h2 className="branch__subtitle">Lending a Hand</h2>
      <p className="branch__text">
        The Branch's members have always be ready to lend a helping hand
        wherever and whenever needed as, for example, in the housing and feeding
        many of those affected by Hurricane Hazel in October 1954 and by the
        Mississauga train derailment in 1979.

      </p>
      <h1 className="branch__title">The Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 101</h1>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Shortly after the Branch was chartered in June of 1927, the Ladies
        Auxiliary followed suit with 15 charter members.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Their first president was Mrs. Pete Nicholson, whose husband was a
        charter member of the Branch, later to become a Branch president.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        A most notable member of the Auxiliary and their eldest is Lil Staughton
        who recalls that, during the dark days of the Second World War, members
        of the Auxiliary were on hand to "meet and greet" the wounded and
        disabled who were returning day and night at Union Station. They could
        also be seen handing out gift parcels to Armed Forces personnel
        departing from Exhibition Stadium for the various theatres of war.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        For her exploits, the Auxiliary has awarded Lil a Medal of Merit and Bar
        and, in 1985, a 60th diamond jubilee pin. In 1976, she was awarded the
        Legion's_SOth Anniversary service medal and, this year, the Legion
        Jubilee service medal.
      </p>
      <p className="branch__text">
        Without a doubt, Branch 101 would not exist as it stands today were it
        not for the steady and dedicated contributions of time, services and
        money provided by the members of the Ladies Auxiliary. In particular,
        the ladies have contributed substantially over the years with the
        proceeds from their weekly bingo and euchre nights, and their catering
        function. May God bless them all!
