HISTORY OF THE LEGIONS

SIR WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL BRANCH
OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN LEGION

The Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League was instituted ii
Winnipeg> Manitoba- in the year 1926 In the following year - 1927 fifteen veterans of
the New Toronto applied for and received a charter to be known as Lakeshore Ontario
No. 3 Branch of the Canadian Legion - B.E.S.L.

The charter members were Percy Flint, Sidney Wilmott, William Lomas, Thomas Derry,
Authur Rigby, Robert Armour, Ralph , George Moore Jr., Sydney Finch, Arthur
Fletcher, James Yuili, Sr. Magnuo Armour, Daniel Smyth, Joseph Nuni and Roy Lush.
Through their own efforts and that held their association of the time, they saw that
guidelines that have enabled us to go from strength to strength over the past 58 years.

The first home of Branch 3 was sometimes termed as a storeroom over Heathcote
Hardware situation on the north side of Lakeshore road between Fifteenth and Sixteenth
Streets. In this small room they helped needy veterans in the area who had served in the
Boer War and First World War - and the widows and families of those who had perished
as a result of their service in conflicts.

After spending four years in the above premises in 193_ Branch 3 moved to the old
Orange Hall on Tenth Street. The renovations on the outside and inside were
accomplished through the efforts of the members to make the hall a more suitable
meeting place, where Legion activities could also be expanded to accommodate the increasing membership.

In 1935, once again Branch 3 moved - this time to Sandford Barn located on the laneway
south of Lakeshore Road between Eight and Ninth Streets. This building was also
refurbished by the members. It was no small task converting a barn where horses had
been kept to a suitable meeting place for the ever increasing membership.

The biggest event in the history of Branch 3 to that date happened in 1941 when the
membership voted at a general meeting to purchase a building on Seventh Street north of
Birmingham Street. That building has been built by Browns Brass which later became
Anaconda American Brass and is now Arrowhead Metals Limited, The building had
been built-in as a rooming house for the employees of Brown Brass in 192_, the building
was purchased by Mowhawk Radio who turned it into a radio factory.

On December 29, 1941 permission was granted by Dominion Command to rename our Branch after Britain’s wartime prime minister and the branch became known as Winston
Spencer Churchill Branch 3 of the Canadian Legion - B,E.S.L.

During the war years the Branch was very active. The Branch executive and members
organized and held entertainment nights in the Capitol theater on the corner of Fourth
Street and Lakeshore Road. The monies raised from these Sunday night events was used
to send cigarettes and comforts to men and women from New Toronto serving in the
Armed Forces. After VE Day and VJ Day in 1945 and into 1946, Comrade Fred Barrett,
member of the Branch executive met every troop train arriving at the CNE grounds to
welcome the returning veterans and arrange for their transportation homeward. The
Branch also arranged the transportation of their own members and families to go to meet
their returning loved ones.

In 1953, when Churchill was knighted, Branch 3 immediately applied for and was
granted permission to change our name this time to Sir Winston Spencer Churchill Branch 3.

In 1958 by order-in -council, Dominion Command passed a resolution that the British
Empire Service League be dropped and that all branches be known as “The Canadian Legion “.

In 1961 “Royal was added but and became known as “The Royal Canadian Legion: the
name we use today.

After 2_ years of operation on 26_ Seventh Street the need for repair was becoming more
essential and the need for better facilities for the swelling membership. It was regularly
passed at a general meeting that we would build a new hall immediately to the north on
an adjoining property that had been purchased with forsightedness a_few years earlier.

This spanking new Legion hall was officially opened in 1963 with a number of well
known dignitaries present in the modern banquet room.

On February 25, 1977, Branch 3 celebrated their 50th anniversary at a banquet with
Provincial President David Capperauld as guest speaker. The evening concluded with dancing.

In 1975 a couple of year earlier we had been informed by Metropolitan Toronto that we
were being expropriated to make way for the southward extension of Islington Avenue.
This forced the Branch into purchasing property and building a new home at 15 Eight
Street, a block or so to the southwest. Ultimately in July 1978 the doors were opened to
the membership. The official opening of the new premises that we occupy today was
held on February 24, 1979 with the Dominion President as a guest speaker at the ceremony and banquet.

Looking to the future Branch 3 should be here for many years to come enabling us to
carry on with the aims and objects laid down by our Comrades who first started Branch 3
in 1927. We are well known in the community for helping veterans and their windows
and families, for supporting community sports and senior citizen groups and for providing bursaries in the educational fields. As time marches on Branch 3 will be ever
striving to serve the community on an even greater scale.

THE LADIES AUXILIARY OF LEGION BRANCH 3

The Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 3 received its original charter on January 13, 1947 but
little of their early activities have been recorded. In 1960 however the ladies elected
Mary Fleming as their president for the year 1960 and 1961. Later in 1978 Mary joined
James Clark in turning the soil for the new building on Eighth Street.

On March 5, 1971 the charter was re-constituted and established as Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (Ontario No. 3) Branch of the Ladies Auxiliary, Dorothy Brag_ was the
President in 1971 when they were presented with their new charter.

HISTORY OF THE NEW TORONTO CENOTAPHS

In 1919 a group of interested citizens of New Toronto comprising mainly veterans and
wives, widows and mothers of veterans formed an association known as “The New
Toronto Comfort Association. Their main objective was to assist First World War
veterans and their families and to raise funds for a cenotaph that would be a fitting
memorial to the men and women of New Toronto who had paid the supreme sacrifice in
the war. This was successfully accomplished the same year and on November 11, 1919,
the cenotaph was dedicated during the Rememberance Day Service. It was situation on
the southwest corner of Lakeshore Road and Eight Street.

After the Second World War, the Goodyear Overseas Veterans Association and the
Anaconda Veterans Association met the members of Branch 3 each year, without fail at
the old cenotaph on the corner of Lakeshore Road and Eighth Street on November 11th
for memorial services.

The Goodyear Vets paraded from the Goodyear, the Anaconda Vets paraded from the
Anaconda and Branch 3 paraded from the old Legion Hall on Seventh Street__each
arriving about five minutes to the hour for the service. After the service the respective
groups paraded back to their starting points.

In 1953 a delegation from Branch 3 met with the mayor and council at the Twon of New
Toronto with the intent on having a new cenotaph constructed in a more convenient and
prominent location which would commemorate not only the First World War dead of
1914-1918 but also those who gave their lives for their country in the Second World War
of 1939 - 45 and the Korean war of 1950-53.

After many meetings the town father passed a resolution that a new cenotaph would be
erected on property adjacent to the Town Hall on the southeast corner of Birmingham and
Fifth Streets. It was duly erected and was dedication on the Remembrance Day Service
on November 1954. The last service at this location was November 1982 as after further
negotiations with the New City of Etobicoke this Cenotaph and the older one were both
relocated to where you see them today in from of our present building - just in ime for
our Remembrance Day Service in November 1983.

At the VE Day Service on May 6, 1984 the members of Branch 3 gathered together to
witness the re-dedication of these two cenotaphs and consecration of the ground they
stand on as a constant reminder of those men and women who made the supreme sacrifice
on behalf of their country and fellow men during both World Wars and the Korean War.

Each year services at the cenotaph are held on the Sunday before November I 1th this
being the beginning of Poppy Week on November 11th at 11:00 a.m. a small group of
veterans gather at the cenotaph for a short wreath laying service in memory of those who
paid the supreme sacrifice.

LONG BRANCH BRANCH 101
OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN LEGION

Chartered in June 1927, Long Branch Branch 101 of the Canadian Legion of the British
Empire Service League quickly established itself as a leading component of the local
scene. In the ensuing 59 years, membership grew from 16 original charter members to
the point now where Branch 101 boasts a roll-call in excess of 1100.

Many of the older types are still quite involved in Branch activities, and display at
least as much energy, or more, as some of the young ones do.

Regrettably, none of the charter members remain with us today. But Ed Haylock,
whose father, Joseph Edward, was a veteran of the South African campaign at the turn
of the century, and whose uncle Tom was wounded and gassed in the Great World
War, still visits the Branch regularly.

Early and Present Quarters

The first Branch-owned premises was a house "out in the woods" on Thirty-Fifth
Street, which unfortunately was destroyed by fire in 1937. However, it was replaced
shortly afterwards by a larger hall constructed next door, with much of the labour
volunteered by Branch members and their friends to help minimize costs.

The main structure of the present building, erected at 3850 Lakeshore Boulevard West
in co-operation with the incumbent reeve, Marie Curtis, and local builders, craftsmen,
suppliers and merchants, was formally opened on May 24, 1958. It was
subsequently enlarged considerably and re-dedicated in June 1967.

Community Involvement

From its inception 59 years ago, the Branch has been active in the community, through
provision of financial assistance to local hospitals, church organizations, scouts and
guides, and sports groups. Local students have benefited from our annual public
speaking, literary and poster contests sponsored under the Branch's youth education
program, and from a university —scholar-ship established by the Ladies Auxiliary in
honour of the Branch's charter president, Dr. H.R. Adams.

Some Notable Members

Although not an original charter member, Harry Staughton became a highly respected
president of the Branch. Our Quiet Room is named after that fine gentleman.
Tastefully furnished in March 1962 by the Ladies Auxiliary, this room bears testimony
to the indebtedness of the Branch to Harry, one of its three recipients of the Legion Meritorious Service Medal, the highest award that Dominion
Command confers ona member. The others have been Reta McCrindle (deceased)
and Bruce Robertson. Harry's LMSM also bore the Palm Leaf in recognition of his
outstanding service to the community.

Earlier, in 1950, Harry had been made a life member, and on November 12, 1981,
he was presented with a watch and fob by the Branch to celebrate his 90th birthday,
accompanied by a congratulatory message from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

George Thistle, a past Branch President now living in Orillia, remembers hell on
earth as a combatant with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in three of the big battles in
Europe during the Great War.

Dave Robb remains reticent about his winning of the Distinguished Flying Cross
and the Air Force Cross during RCAF sorties over Europe as leader of a Lancaster
bomber squadron during the Second World War.

Bruce Robertson, who flew 100 operations on armed reconnaissance and convoy escort
missions with the RCAF in PBY Catalina flying boats in the Burmese campaign,
remembers the good times with Len Birchall, his commanding officer for a time.

And Don (Fergie) Ferguson, one of our congenial bar stewards since 1980, would
prefer to speak of his father-in-law, Fred Shaw, a charter member of the Branch and
one of the early police chiefs of Long Branch, than to think of his 15 missions with
the RCAF over occupied Europe as a rear-gunner in ZLQ "Queenie", a Canadian-built
Lancaster bomber.

Lending a Hand

The Branch's members have always be ready to lend a helping hand wherever and
whenever needed as, for example, in the housing and feeding many of those affected
by Hurricane Hazel in October 1954 and by the Mississauga train derailment in 1979.

Other Significant Events to Remember

1962 - Branch 101 of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League
formally became Branch 101 of the Royal Canadian Legion.

1964 - Muriel Jacklin was sworn in as first’ ex-servicewoman of the Branch, by
President Nat Pollock.

1966 - Part of our land was expropriated by the Ontario Government to
accommodate the GO train service, for which the Branch was recompensed $20,350.

1967 - An HMCS Haida plaque was presented to the Branch as a gift by Carl
Rogers. A display of war memorabilia was officially dedicated in the new building
extension. And, the Branch celebrated its 40th anniversary.

1969 - Return comradeship was established with Waterford Post 285 of the American
Legion, Erie No. 470 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Erie (Millbrook) Post 773 of
the American Legion, all in the State of Pennsylvania.

1974 - A plaque was donated to the Branch by the Ghurkas.

1975 - The Rainbow Room, formerly Orchid Room, had its name changed again... to
the Red Caboose Room. And, a contingent of Dutch war veterans visited the Branch.

1976 - The 50th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Legion was celebrated for a week.

1977 - The SOth birthday of the Branch was celebrated, and Reverend Howard L.
Shantz, M.A., D.D., was installed as Branch Padre.

1978 - Through an anonymous telephone call, a bomb threat to the Branch was received
which, after a police search, proved to be a hoax. Through police and media efforts,
the perpetrator was apprehended and suitably dealt with.

1979 - A friendship plaque was presented to the Branch by our confreres in American
Legion (Millcreek) Post 773, Erie, PA.

1980 - The annual Toronto District D "Old Sweats" dinner was held at Branch 101,
attended by more than 200 veterans of the First World War.

THE LADIES AUXILIARY OF BRANCH 101

Shortly after the Branch was chartered in June of 1927, the Ladies Auxiliary followed
suit with 15 charter members.

Their first president was Mrs. Pete Nicholson, whose husband was a charter member of
the Branch, later to become a Branch president.

A most notable member of the Auxiliary and their eldest is Lil Staughton who recalls
that, during the dark days of the Second World War, members of the Auxiliary were on
hand to "meet and greet" the wounded and disabled who were returning day and night at
Union Station. They could also be seen handing out gift parcels to Armed Forces
personnel departing from Exhibition Stadium for the various theatres of war.

For her exploits, the Auxiliary has awarded Lil a Medal of Merit and Bar and, in 1985, a
60th diamond jubilee pin. In 1976, she was awarded the Legion's_SOth Anniversary
service medal and, this year, the Legion Jubilee service medal.

Without a doubt, Branch 101 would not exist as it stands today were it not for the steady
and dedicated contributions of time, services and money provided by the members of the
Ladies Auxiliary. In particular, the ladies have contributed substantially over the years with the proceeds from their weekly bingo and euchre nights, and their catering function. May God bless them all!

COL. J.E.L. STREIGHT LEGION BRANCH 210

The Early Years

Etobicoke Branch 210 of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire League was granted
its charter on August 12, 1931. In those days meeting halls, like many other facilities,
were in short supply, with the result that the Branch's monthly meetings were held in
private homes until a room was finally found in the Islington Public School on Cordova Road.

As membership grew, the need for more suitable quarters became evident, and a new
home was found at the corner of Bloor and Islington in "Mrs. Dyer's Store". This was
really just an oversize room, but it filled the bill as a place to hold social events and
membership business meetings. The year was still 1931.

These were the days of the "depression" and, almost equally depressing,
"prohibition". Fund-raising was difficult in the extreme, and red ink often appeared on
the Branch's bank statement, but the members were survivors by nature, and their
perseverance ultimately prevailed. Card games, dances, monthly draws and "good
cheer" raffles provided the main revenue for the fledgling organization.

Turning the Corner

At this point, Col. J.E.L. Streight appeared on the scene. A veteran officer of the
Boer War and the First World War, the colonel perceived the plight of the
Legionnaires, who still were lacking a permanent home. He offered them, at modest
rent, a building on Bloor Street just west of Islington Avenue, then known as Ryan's
Barbeque and Dance Hall. This building was located on what is now the east parking
lot of our present property. In 1933 we moved in, and_there we remained until 1944.

A Time of Transition

The Second World War, which exploded upon us in 1939 and continued inabated
for six years, saw thousands of young men and women gathered to the Armed Forces.
Our need was starkly clear --larger premises to accommodate the flood of veterans who
would be returning to our midst.

Early in 1943, largely through the efforts of then branch president, William
McKenzie, a plan was conceived to erect a new building that would be large enough to
meet our foreseeable needs and prestigious enough to befit our growing municipality,
and to serve as a tribute to those who had served and as a memorial to those who
inevitably would not return.

A committee was formed to approach Col. Streight with a proposal to purchase the
property. It was hoped that an arrangement would be agreed upon whereby the

Page 10



|
Branch could embark on the immense task of assembling the necessary to funding for
a new building. The colonel was so generous in his terms that it seemed only fitting
to re-name the Branch in his honour. And so it was that we became Col. J.E.L. Streight
Branch 210 of the Canadian Legion--B.E.S.L., after the appropriate changes had been
made to our charter. But, we still had no building!

Under the leadership of Comrade McKenzie and the good offices of Cyrus B. Payne
and other early members, an initial amount of $20,000 was subscribed to cover
preliminary costs. To raise the balance of funds needed, it was again Col. Streight who
came to the rescue in a unique way. He provided funds to construct a bungalow on
Dundas Street, to be put up as the winning prize in a gigantic raffle. The house became
known as "Victory Villa", and thousands of raffle tickets were sold world-wide at $1.00
each. It is comforting to recall that, when the lucky ticket was drawn at a huge picnic
and rally at Central Park, the winner was a young soldier serving at the time in
Germany.

With funds in hand, the original $20,000 of interim financing was retired, and
construction was begun of the present building designed by architects Hanks and Erwin
and completed by general contractor James Seeback. The new building was
officially dedicated, free of debt, on Sunday, December 16, 1945.

After V-J Day

Membership continued to grow in the immediate post-war period, and with growth
came gradual change.

In 1949, Charles D. Hardy was the first WW-II veteran to be elected president of the
Branch. Under his leadership, veterans of both wars became united on the executive
council to begin building a solid future for the Branch. We were at last off and running.

But we had not run far when in 1950 a fire broke out in the lower clubrooms. In
retrospect, this might now be viewed as a blessing in disguise for, in the ensuing years,
major modifications and improvements resulted, including installation of a new bar,
a soundproof drop-ceiling, new furniture and carpeting.

This was a time also when new community projects were undertaken. The Branch
became involved with the Kingsway Youth Baseball League, the West Mall Hockey
Association and other youth-oriented programs and activities. These programs and
several others are still among Branch 210's ongoing community projects.

To digress for a moment, on the 35th anniversary of the Canadian Legion
in 1960, the Queen gave her consent for the Legion to affix the " Royal" before
its name. The national organization was then officially re-named the Royal Canadian Legion.

During the early 1960's, development of our fine auditorium was eee ot: snes
Coach Light Room, this facility has proven to be a boon, not only to Br rae Me aie
the community as a whole. An elevator was installed to facilitate the wo ota
Auxiliary, that indefatigable group of dedicated women to whom we owe

The Perils of Progress

November 15, 1966, was a red-letter day in the history of the Branch. By aa
post we were advised that part of our lands were to be expropriated by Metro she
and the Toronto Transit Commission as a result of the inexorable westward pee the
subway. We were to lose some 12,000 square feet of land, the equivalent of forty
parking spaces. It was time to fight, again!

The ensuing battle was classic. But, when the smoke had cleared, the negotiators won
more land than they had surrendered, and the expropriating authorities picked up the tab,
which was sizable.

Almost a decade of serenity followed until, on Good Friday, 1975, a truly serious blaze
erupted , which caused heavy fire damage to the roof and upper floors of the building,
and water damage to the lower areas.

Once more the fight-back spirit prevailed, and by mid-summer Branch 210 had been
restored "ship-shape and Bristol-fashion".

The Uxorious Years

The "seventies" were marked by extraordinary and profound changes in the Legion
organization. Long the bastion of male chauvinism, the Branch, which had successfully
fought financial struggles, fires, floods, legal battles, politicians and the Establishment,
fell before the subtle blandishments of the fair sex. The ancient shibboleths of
masculine suzerainty disappeared. The "no females" tule passed into history. Ex-
service women were granted full membership privileges.

Other major changes have since been implemented, including broadening of the
Associate class of membership to accept sons and daughters of ex-service personnel,
with full voting privileges and the right to hold office.

Looking Forward

This year, as we observe the Diamond Jubilee of the Royal Canadian Legion, we
are proud that Branch 210 is not only flourishing, but is also planning further
expansion in new premises. Construction is expected to gel underway by the Shipp
Corporation in the near future. The new building will be located immediately to the
west of our present site and will be totally modern in every respect. Floor area will be
about doubled and parking facilities greatly expanded.

Page 12

And Finally

Our history is rich in colour and content. If we have heroes, they are those who serve
in the front line of Legion and those who have done so in the past. Our Branch is the
lengthening shadow of all who have gone before. Unfortunately, a roll-call of the men
and women to whom we are collectively indebted is not possible here. Nor is a detailed
chronological recitation of events. We have touched only the highlights.

ON THE DISTAFF SIDE OF BRANCH 210

The late Joseph Conrad wrote..."Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it
consists principally in dealing with men". The Ladies Auxiliary of Col J.E.L. Streight
Branch 210 have met this challenge and won the day.

It was in 1931, the year of the Branch's founding, that the Ladies Auxiliary of the Branch
was formed under the presidency of Ethel Ide, who served in that office until 1935.

As Legion members on the uxorial side, they have made much more than a token
contribution to the Branch during their 55-year existence. Their motto is "Service" and
they have abundantly fulfilled that mandate. Their largesse, their dedication and their
untiring efforts are boundless. As visitors to the sick and aging, as sponsors of fetes
and parties for the benefit of the disadvantaged, and as donors of bursaries and
charitable grants, their ongoing sense of duty to the community marks their dedication.
We appreciate them! We honour them! We salute them!


YEARS OF REMEMBRANCE

Fifty-five years have come and gone since the founding of Legion Branch 210. In
that time members have never forgotten "the fallen". No monthly meeting is ever
opened without the "Silent Tribute" that marks our community of spirit with those
who died on foreign soil.

Each November, the Branch invites all citizens to join them in a ceremony of
Remembrance.

In the early years, these events were marked by parades to various churches, and
subsequently to a memorial cross erected in Central Park. Now, the service is held
at the cenotaph at Etobicoke's civic centre.

This remarkable structure rises eighty feet and is embossed with a 60-foot silver
cross. It stands as a credit to Branch 210 and to the municipal council of the day.
In an historic ceremony the cenotaph was formally dedicated on Nov. 3, 1968,

Page 13

coincident with the 50th anniversary of Armistice Day. It is probably the tallest war
memorial in the land, apart from the Peace Tower in Ottawa.

RANGERS BRANCH 213
OUR FIRST FIFTY-FIVE YEARS

The Queens Rangers in Upper Canada a regiment formed by Lt. Col. John Grave Simcoe
who was destined to become the first Lt. Governor of that Province.

Throughout the course of subsequent history the Rangers were to stand in the forefront of
epic battles and receive many honours and decorations. An American General of the
Revolutionary War had once remarked that the Queens Rangers was the most efficient
single unit on either side. Praise from the enemy is praise indeed.

Rangers Branch 213 of the Royal Canadian Legion draw its name from this illustrious
regiment.

IN THE BEGINNING

Almost every branch of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League
developed from humble origins, Ranger Branch 213 is no exception.

The forerunner of the Canadian Legion was the Great War Veteran Association
which had presence in Weston as early as 1919. Lacking permanent quarters this
small group led an itineran existence until 1921 when they acquired a small
bungalow on Elsemere Avenue.

It is an interesting side-note that in 1928 an independent group formed St. Alban
Branch 118 with its headquarters in the 100 Building on Church Street. This
Branch was fated to short life for in 1931 surrendered its charter and amalgamated
with Ranger Branch 213 when the latter received its charter in November 1931.
The Charter President was W. Matthew’s S. The transition from GMVA to the
Canadian Legion and the amalgamation of the former St. Alban Branch with the
newly formed Branch 213 in 1931 created need for larger premises which were
found over a garage on the other side of Elsemere. There we remained until 1949.

MOVING AHEAD

The year between 1930 and 1931 were uneventful. The great depression was upon
us money was hard to raise and growth was slow, but Legionnaires are fighters by
nature and they persevered. Membership grew slowly reaching only about forty
five but scarcely formidable force in 1939 changed all that. The world exploded in
cataclysm and Branch 213 alone with the Ladies Auxiliary responded as expected.
The records show that the Weston Legion War Service Fund during 1940 - 1945
contributed over half a million cigarettes, 1,570 pairs of knitted socks and two
hundred gift parcels to the 910 members of the armed services from Weston serving
overseas.

Page 15

The members of Rangers Branch 213 foresaw the flood of service men and women
who would be returning to our midst and began to make plans to accommodate
them. The great need was for funds to meet the cost of expansion.

With entrepreneur business acumen they decided to invest in real estate by
purchasing the property adjacent to the club premises. Every member made
personal commitment and contributions regularly each month toward the cost of
acquisition. Then the Ladies Auxiliary added nearly $600 outside contributions
provided sufficient funds to make the downpayment. Three years later the
mortgage was burned in a special ceremony. The time had come to realize profit
and proceed to the business of acquiring a new and more viable location.

The Town of Weston came to the rescue in more way than one. First they donated a
site at 14 Main Street and then further assisted in the project of financing, the Town
also contributed $5,000 from a special “Armed Fore Fund” which had been earlier
established. The new hall was appropriately name the “Legion Memorial Hall”
Although it had human interest this rather momentous occasion the members
contributed their own physical labour. The dedication ceremony was held May 6,
1949.

The trial and tribulation of the last eleven years were offset by success achieved in
Branch activities such as street dances and raffles and by support from private
donors. The tireless efforts ind labour and fund-raising by the Ladies Auxiliary also
provided much needed support.

THE CHANGING SCENE

As the sixties dawned burgeoning membership forces us to recognize that the time had
come again to raise our sights and dream great dreams. We had reached yet another
crossroads, another moment of truth. Our old building was not only inadequate but was
located in a “dry area” which did nothing for the future success or even survival of the
Branch.

We thought about our immediate requirements but with the potential for further
expansion in the future. We needed a location where a license would not be arbitrarily
denied. We found a place at 4 Dennison Road East, a house and lot belonging to the
Dennison estate.

It is largely to Jack Burges that we owe a debt of gratitude for his entrepreneurial skill in
negotiation to turn our dream into reality, Negotiations were opened in 1958 and later in
June 1960 we moved in with full hearts and an empty treasury, n fact the branch purse
had no funds to cover the cost of stocking the bar. This shortfall was personally bridged
by Harry Clark. We were referring to our enterprise as “Phase I” How indomitable is the
human spirit!

Page 16

The sixties proved to be time for real growth. In an eight year period Branch 213 was
awarded Command Annual Six Percent Increase Award.

Midway through the decade the need for premise expansion was recognized. Phase Two
was under way.

Contracts were left and second storey and the little ugly duckling that was our home was
transformed into a prestigious edifice. On April 10, 1965 the formal opening ceremonies
took place benchmarking the history of Branch 213. Many distinguished guest, including
civic officials, members of parliament and senior Legion officers were in attendance.

In recognition of the immense role played by the Ladies Auxiliary it was deemed
appropriate that a special room be set aside for their uses. It is not exactly coincidental
that this room is convenient to the kitchen.

THE WAY WE GROW

Throughout the seventies and into the eighties growth continued apace under the
guidance and leadership of a series of ever able president and senior executive offices and
the precedent setting inauguration of our first lady president Peggy Hamilton who went
on to serve in that office from 1971 to 1983. It is almost redundant to observe that the
success of any organization depends finally on the acumen dedication and administrative
skills of its executive officers. Branch 213 has been fortunate in this regard with a roster
of able and responsible leaders. With pardonable pride we point to some Rangers
Officers who have gone on to higher recognition:

Ria Collins, Past Branch President who has served through Zone, District and Provincial
offices and is Past president of Ontario Provincial Command.

Alex Dobson, Past Deputy Zone D-2 Commander
Jim Weir, Past Deputy Zone Commander
Gord Moore, Past Zone D2 Commander

RANGERS ON PARADE

The Pipe and Drum Band under Pipe Major Wally Eden A Trinkwo and Doug Stinson
have performed in many parades and tournaments through Canada and the USA. The
colour guard under the command of our present Sgt-At-Arms Bob Carsla and his
predecessor have received accolades where it has appeared adding greatly to the
reputation and prestige of Branch 213.

THE SPORTING LIFE

Sports have traditionally played an important role in the varied activities of Ranger
Branch. We have enjoyed many success over the years but win, lose or draw a sense of
friendly competition has always prevailed.

Our sports officer over the years have contributed to the spirit of what good
sportsmanship is all about. Tom Latus in this position since 1968 has an enviable record.
His first year in office was marked by the winning of the Ontario Provincial Cribbage
Championship in Orillia. For over 10 years Ranger cribbage team have played in home
in home series with Queen's Own Rifles Branch 344.

A Team from Rangers have competed in Provincial championship play in euchre,
snooker and shuffleboard and have won Zone and District championships. It was Tom
Latus who convened the euchrethon for five years which raised over $10,000 for Legion
Village. These were grueling 18 hour non-stop events, enough ties for the mettle of the
most intrepid players. Ten pin bowling began eight years ago with a league of twenty
players and now boasts 48 enthusiasts.

Darts is the ever popular mainstay of club activity. Horseshoes is a very popular activity.
Hockey, baseball and broom ball are the other activities in which Branch 213 compete
against other local teams.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

Many of the men and women who hear the haunting drum roll march await rendezvous
with destiny. Those who returned came back to a world forever changing even as they
were forever changed. Then for a special elite who share camaraderie’s and esprit de
corp that is totally exclusive and inestinguisagle. It is the copula that binds Legion
members together.

Born out of the travail of war is the Royal Canadian Legion in nationwide fraternity of
men and women dedicated to the service of the community - the well being of our former
comrades in arms and their families and the preservation of the memory of those who
died in the defense of Canada. The Legion epigraph translated from the Latin, says
simply, "We will remember them!"

"Long quiet are the distant guns
Faint heard the bugle's cry
And muffled, roll the battle drums
Beneath a silent sky."

THE LADIES OF BRANCH 213

Our Ladies Auxiliary came into being with the granting of their charter on May 10, 1932.

The growth of the Auxiliary during the early years was not spectacular reaching only a
scant two dozen by 1940 but their response to the outbreak of hostilities was typical of
the result of a group of women. Reference has been made elsewhere to the volume of the
contribution made to our young people of active service. Many of the resources to
provide these comforts derive from the efforts of the Ladies Auxiliary who raised the
funds through bingo games, weekly luncheons, draws, bazaars, dances and other special
events including monthly games sponsored by the "Euchre Group" held in the members’
homes.

In concert with Auxiliaries from other branches our ladies also took their their turn
serving the Transit Bureau at Union Station where they assisted, advised and provided
small comfort to the troops passing through and greeted those who were returning from
overseas.

With the coming of peace the Auxiliary found itself deeply involved in fund raising to
help with the expense of relocating the Branch and the attendance increased cost of
operation. To do this they began acting to service clubs and other associations as well as
private social events and weddings while continuing with the Saturday night bingos.
When in June 1960 we moved to Dennison Avenue it was the Auxiliary that provided the
funds to equip the kitchen with the major appliances and covered other capital costs.

As in every organization their is always an on-going ebb and flow in membership through
illness, retirement, transfer and other uncontrollable factors. From time to time the
Auxiliary has feelen victim to these eventualities and it is tribute to their indefatigable
spirit that the group continues to be vital and enduring unit of the Legion.

A tribute to Olive Mattison, 42 year member of the Branch 213 Ladies Auxiliary who
served eleven years as President of the Auxiliary. She held no fewer than six Legion
medals including the highest award for meritorious service from Dominion Command
and a Certificate of Appreciation from Ontario Command. Miss Mattison a native of
Weston, passed away in December 1982, in her 83rd year.

MIMICO--HUMBER BAY LEGION BRANCH 217,
THE EARLY YEARS
Mimico - Humber Bay Branch 217 of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
League received its charter on January 8, 1932. Comrade Fred Wiltshire presided over
the Branch or Post as we were known in those days, during the formative years of 1932
and 1933 Branch 217 was in fact a splinter ground from Lakeshore Branch e a move that
transpired when veterans in the Humber Bay Mimico area realized that they might be
better served through having an identity of their own.

During the “hungry thirties” hardship was rampant because of the great depression and
many veterans of the Great World War were hard pressed financially. A group of
veterans from that area had set about in 1930 to obtain membership in the Canadian
Legion of the British Empire Service League the name of the national organization of the
time. After obtaining their charter, their first meetings were held in private homes until
use was gained of St. Andrews Hall on Church Street and Royal York Road.

Shortly thereafter improved space was found on the second floor of the “piano factory”
on Royal York Road and Newcastle Street.

Early in 1933, yet another move was made, this time to Bailey House on “the hill”
located just west of Park Lawn Avenue on the street now named Legion Road. The
house was formerly owned by Sir Henry Pellatt of Casa Loma fame. Rent was $1.00 per
year payable to the Township of Etobicoke.

Tales are still told of the good times had on the hill - dancing under the stars on Saturday
nights to Wally Bromby’s orchestra on the open air floor built by the members, of the
corn roasts, the card parties and the picnics. Admission for some functions was 25 cents -
which included sandwiches prepared by the Ladies Auxiliary and a quart of beer,
bootlegged of course.

It was in November 1033 that the first memorial supper was held in Connaught Hall on
Mimico Avenue. This memorable event grew into an annual supper known as “The Old
Sweats Dinner” in honour of the Great War veterans from the surrounding district.

During this period many interesting articles of the happenings of the Branch were
submitted to The Lakeshore Advertiser, and other media. These clippings are preserved
in a book and bring back many memories not only of the Legion but of the local
community as well.

Page 20

eee

Those were the depression years and only the great efforts and zeal of the members left,
but their presidents and executive bodies led to survival of the Branch and eventual
prosperity. There was very little cash to be had, and from 193_ to 193_ the presidents
and their committees were hard pressed to finance the efforts and projects. To their
everlasting credit they did succeed and Branch 217 did survive and flourish where many
others failed because of financial or other problems. |

THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND AFTERWARDS

In 1938 we moved to a house on Drummond Street at the time when clouds were
gathering over Europe. Undaunted though, the members made plans to construct a new
meeting hall on a lot next to the house. Many problems were encountered with shortage
of materials and tradesmen and other obstacles. But these were eventually overcome and
in 1951 a new building was completed. It was named The David Hornell Memorial Hall
in honour of the Mimico man who was the first officer of the RCAF to be awarded
(posthumously) the Victoria Cross.

Many members will be remembered for their contribution to the new hall on Drummond
Street and to the veterans cause and the community. One well remembered is Comrade
Charlie Ring a veteran of the Spanish American War who fought with Teddy Roosevelt’s
Rough Riders. Comrade Ring was wounded at San Juan Hill in Texas. Later he moved
to Mimico became a Canadian citizen and joined Branch 217. He is well remembered for
his valuable aid in the construction of the new hall and for his many other projects in the
Legion and the community.

During the second World War Branch 217 was kept busy with efforts to help shorten the
conflict. Men and women from the are who volunteered for active service were
remembered by parcels from the Branch. Many of those who returned became members
of the Branch to carry on the traditions of the Legion.

Later in 1951 a disastrous fire gutted the recently opened building on Drummond Street.
Many records and much memorabilia were destroyed. After the Drummond Street
building had been gutted the decision was made to purchase the building we now own on
Royal York Road and negotiations were entered into with the owner, William Morrisey.
The building in itself had a very interesting and historical background being the old
Edward Stock homestead. The Stock family were early pioneers in the area and had
erected this home in 1887 when the surrounding area was farmland.

When negotiations were completed and the Branch moved into the new quarters there
were many things to be done to prepare the building for Meetings and social functions. A
member was contracted to add on what is now the main hall - this was completed in 1954
and was following by a strong of other renovations.

The downstairs club room was completed in 196] and during this time became known as
the Royal Canadian Legion instead of the Canadian Legion--B.E.S.L. :

In 1966 when the Town of Mimico was incorporated into the Borough of Etobicoke, the
town colours were presented to the Branch for safe keeping.

Other renovations to the building included the addition of a ladies lounge, a new front
entrance, extensive revision of the plumbing and heating and a new bar and kitchen on
the second floor in the period from 1968 to 1973.

In 1983 another major renovation was completed with the combining of the ladies lounge
and the men’s clubroom into one opening and one 3 foot wall that separated the two.

AN EPILOGUE

Over the years the spiritual guidance of the Branch has been well serviced by Rev. W.
Watt, Rev. R. A. Wigby and now Rev. Keith Kiddell.

“We will remember them is part of the Royal Canadian Legion’s pledge and Branch 217
has exhibited this in many ways, one of these being a very active Poppy Committee.
Over the years this committee has raised funds through the sale of poppies to alleviate the
stress and hardship suffered by the less fortunate of our veterans and their families.

In its 54 year history through good times and lean, peace and war, Branch 217 has always
been in the foreground of the community and of veterans and Legion activities.
Sponsorship of hockey, ball, lacrosse and other team sports for the youth, the awarding of
bursaries to deserving students, help for our members down on their luck, assistance to
Red Cross blood donor clinics and outings for our senior citizens, are but a few of the
many commendable endeavors undertaken by the members.

This is but a brief account of a proud Branch of The Royal Canadian Legion whose
members now join comrades across Canada in celebrating their Jubilee year. The value
of the Branch to veterans and to the community in difficult times for who can estimate
the intangible spirit of co-operation that has been the backbone of the Branch through the
years. For fifty four years - Mimico Humber Bay Branch 217 has been in the forefront
with other larger and possibly more affluent branches.

We have tried to record here some of the good times along with the bad. May the Branch
and the Legion celebrate many more birthdays in the years ahead.

THE LADIES OF BRANCH 217

The history of the Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 217 in a large way paralleled that of the
Branch. Although the Auxiliary and the Branch have together suffered many frustrations,
a great number of joint efforts have been brought to a happy conclusion through the
generous co-operation of both arms of the Branch.

When Frances Lomax and her colleagues held their early meeting to prepare an
application for a charter from Dominion Command, conditions were much different that
they are today. The memory of the First World War was still fresh in the minds of the
people. The suffering of the wounded who had returned home, the hardships of the
widows and families of those who would never return and the deprivation caused by the
great depression weight heavily on the shoulders of every one. However, this band of
courageous ladies undertook to form an auxiliary arm of the still unchartered Mimico-
Humber Bay Branch of the Canadian Legion. They were indeed very jubilant when their
charter was granted on the same date as that of the Branch, January 8, 1932.

A special project of the Ladies Auxiliary is the bursary grants program. These grants are
to veterans children who may need financial assistance to further their education. Funds
for a special project of the Ladies Auxiliary is the bursary grants program. These grants
are to veterans children who may need financial assistance to further their education.
Funds for this and other projects have been raised_through such endeavors as annual
bazaars, rummage sales and bake sales.

In 1963 the first Ladies Concert was produced under the direction of Molly Dixon. These
shows have become a tradition with Branch 217 and have been enjoyed by many people
both at the Branch and at outside locations. In later years the show has been under the
capable direction of Doreen Strader and Marion Boyd. The enthusiasm of all who take
part marks the enthusiasm of all members of the Auxiliary in general.

One of the senior ladies, in age, but not in effort is Lil Redding, who joined the Ladies
Auxiliary in 1933 and was initiated in January of that year by President Lomas in the old
Mimico Town Hall, which was then the Methodist Church on Church Street. The Ladies }
held their meetings in the church and later at the old Beech House and Lil tells us that the |
dues were ten cents a month.

Many happy meetings were held in private homes where quilting bees, sewing parties,
both social and card parties were held and many pleasant evenings can be recalled by the
older members.

Another community effort of the ladies has been their aid to the Salvation Army for many
years in canvassing the homes in the area for funds.

May this dedication that has been so greatly exhibited in the past fifty four years be
carried through the next half century.

THE EARLY YEARS OF MAPLE LEAF BRANCH 266



While researching background material of the Branch, we came across transcripts of early 
interviews with three of our “old sweats” from the First World Ward - Tommy Bonner, 
George James, and Bill Gornell (now deceased).

Rather than rewriting history, we felt that the following excerpt from their interviews
would make for an interesting insightful and informative account of 266’s early years.
We hope you will agree:

FORMING UP!

Bonner - “Now here is some of the history our Legion Branch 266. It was started as an
independent club, with a committee of six veterans in the late twenties. The first
president was Charles Jackson who worked at the CPO. Comrade Jackson was interested
in veterans activities and had asked me and five more veterans if we were interested in
starting our own club. Eventually the six of us gave Charles permission to apply for a
charter, which was granted on October 4, 1934.”

THE HOUSE ON JANE STREET

Bonner - “We all knew a man named Bill Ward who owned an old house on Jane Street
and he would sell it for $1,500. We had a meeting and put $50.00 amounts us down - the
rest was paid at 5% interest. Then we did some repairs amongst our little group. A
veteran named Bob Johnson had no home, so we let him live in the house and look after it
for us.”

Bonner - “Then we decided how we could make some money to pay the interest and get
some returned men to join. The committee got together, but West Toronto was dry, so
one of the boys said, ‘If we can get some cases of beer to sell, we would soon get some
customers.’ A member said he would look after the beer, which he did, and we sold it at
a good profit."

Bonner - "Our furniture was an old Quebec heater and a couple of sofa chairs. We made
a table and were doing fine till one day the police were coming to see us. Bob burned all
our records in the stove so that the police could not summon us for selling beer without a
license. So we, the committee had to find some other way to make some money.”

James - “As far back as I can remember, the club bought a four room cottage and made it
into two rooms. It had a small bar and big old box to keep the beer in. Vic Hill used to
bring the ice in the summertime every other day. The club would hold between thirty and
forty members. It was filled all the time. Bill Howard was the first steward. He worked
the day shift. Bill Hanson was the night steward.”

Gormell - “Everybody turned out for a parade and on meeting nights. Everybody helped
the club to get along.” i

Page 24

James - “Before they got their charter there were a few members and myself who would
go over on a Sunday afternoon and a few times during the week for beer at 20 cents a pint
or three quarts for a $1. But somehow the law walked in and the club was charged with
bootlegging! It was closed down!”

Gormell - “I couldn’t tell you the year we broke away from that Army and Navy. When I
joined the club, I know I was made 2Sth or 26th member”

James - “After they received their charter in October 1934, there were about 70 members.
Most of them were Englishmen, Scotsmen and a few Canadians. There was a piano in
one corner. When the piano was played and the sing-song was in progress it was just like
Armistice Day. This was a weekly ritual on the weekends. There was always a card
game going on, cribbage and euchre.”

Gormell - “At one meeting night on Jane Street during the early part of the Second World
War, the club voted for $25 towards the British War Veterans Fund. Going home that
night I was thinking to myself $25 is not much. I had a gold watch and chain which
needed repair. I took it to the watchmaker and got it repaired. I went back Friday night
for the shindig and I gave to watch to Bob Ede and told him to raffle it off towards the
$25.

“The time came for me to draw that lucky ticket, who should I pick but my friend. I
could have dropped through the floor. Anyway, he gave it back for the next month. That
watch was raffled off three times in three months, that fund swelled us good - close to
$85 - if 1 am not mistaken - for the British Veterans Fund. Nearly $100 was eventually
sent over.

The funny part was there was a Telegram reporter there and he wanted to take a pitcher of
the winner and me standing behind the table holding the watch up.

The next night I was looking for the picture in the paper. There was no picture, just a
write-up and I enquired why the picture wasn’t in the paper, they told me there were too
many beer bottles on the table so they couldn’t publish the picture. We had a good laugh
about that!”

Bonner - “When we were still located on Jane Street the committee thought of another
way to make money. I would go to a small store on Dundas Street at High Park Avenue
and rent fifty bingo cards for one dollar. We rented the upstairs of that old small store on
Dundas at High Park Avenue and rent fifty bingo cards for one dollar. We rented the
"upstairs of the old Fire Hall Ernie Woods as there was not enough room in our premises.
The prizes were groceries and this helped us to raise a little money every three weeks
towards a new building as well as for the unfortunate veterans in the vicinity. We
advertised on a notice board on the front lawn near the sidewalk at the house on Jane
Street, which helped us a great deal to get players to come in and join us.”

Page 25

od

Grovel - “T helped to get that Jane Street hall ready, but it got too small for us. We were
going to build on the same premises but that felt through, so we bought a house on
Dundas Street next to the club we are in now.” (Ed note - this was in the 1942-43
period.)

THE FARMHOUSE ON DUNDAS STREET

Bonner - “We had a veteran join the Legion, who was a lawyer named Captain. A small
committee was formed and he stated that he had instructions to sell the old building and
land on Dundas Street West and if the committee could find $10,000 then he could
purchase it. We then went and saw the bank manager along on Dundas Street, who
advised us the best thing to do was to sell bonds and he would lend us $10,000. We had
the bonds drawn up in denominations of $10. and $20 paying 5% interest. The bonds
were sold to members and anybody else who would buy them. After selling the house on
Jane Street and issuing the bonds, the property on Dundas Street was purchased."

Gormell - “In our spare time we all volunteered and tore all the inside of the house on
Dundas Street. We all pitched in every night till we got finished late at night at 11:00
o'clock, sometimes 11 o’clock at night. We gave our service free. We didn’t expect
anything, but it only helped the club”

Grovel - “When we got the hall ready, I supplied the lights, kept them supplied with
lights. I brought the water pipe free of charge and donated that. I wasn’t the only one all
the club members helped every night until we got the place finished.”

Grovel - “When we were ready to move in from the house on Jane Street each one carried
the tables and chairs and marched along Jane Street. We pushed the piano up along the
street, playing the piano along the way - and we all had a good time.”

James - “The RCAF gave Legion Branch 266 an invitation to take part in their next
parade at Manning Pool in 1942 at the Exhibition Grounds. We were commended for our
great turnout at this parade. Three carloads went to that parade. After which we were all
invited to the Air Force canteen. We could drink all the beer we wanted at 10 cents a
pint. As you can imagine quite a bit of beer was consumed. The six fellows who went in
my car decided to go to the old National Hotel on the corner of King and Sherbourne
Streets, which was noted for the lovely hookers...".

James - “In the summertime they would charter a couple of buses, load up with beer and
head of to Midland on a fishing expedition. As soon as we got out of the city the beer
would start to flow. When we got to Midland we hired a boat. Most would sit on deck
drinking beer and a handful would fish. When it was time to go home most of them
would go to the fish store and buy fish they would proudly carry home claiming to have
caught themselves.”

Page 26

THE NEW HALL ON DUNDAS STREET

Grovel - “The club on Dundas Street prospered. The house got too small for us so we
decided to float bonds and we built up the hall as you got it now - a lot of hard work, a lot
of volunteers for nothing - and we got a big kick out of doing it for nothing."

Bonner - “The property of Dundas Street was paid for in five years. Then we the
committee decided to tear down the old farmhouse and anybody that wanted any one of
the bricks or old lumber could have what they wanted. Then we all got together and
cleaned the property up.”

Grovel - “When we got that fixed up we got a free bottle of beer and enjoyed ourselves
doing it.”

Bonner - “With the money we raised we got busy and built Legion 266 as it now stands
with the help of different members, most who gave their time free to get a nice new home
for the veterans and their relations. With the different presidents carrying on with the
good work of the members, it had all helped to make it as it is today. (Ed note. The
building cornerstone was placed on May 11, 1946, by Victoria Cross winner “Toppy”
Topham, a renowned member of Branch 266.)

Grovel -”We used to have lots of entertainment to get the funds to rund the club.”

James - “They had a number of members who used to go to other clubs to compete in
euchre or cribbage tournaments. They used to do really well. Every month or two
months they would hold a church parade - alternating between the Church of the Advent,
the Salvation Army and St. Paul’s Angling Church on Willard Avenue. These parades
were led by Boy Scouts Bands and the Salvation Army Band. They would always have a
good turnout. People would come out on their verandahs to see them all march by
dressed in full regalia - cream pants and navy blue blazers. The colour party bearing the
flags followed the bands.”

LOOKING BACK!

Bonner - “Those were great days getting established. But unfortunately, a lot of the
names escape me now."

James - “Most of the members were on a very small pension, some ready to retire and
others were on the pogie. It is too bad that the time for them were not as they are today.”

Grovel - “Those were the good old days at 266.”

CORPORAL FREDERICK GEORGE TOPHAM, V.C.
1917-1974

Born in Toronto “Toppy” Topham was educated here before working in the mines at
Kirkland Lake. He enlisted on August 30, 1942 and served at home and abroad as a
medical orderly.

March 24, 1945, while serving with the Ist Canadian Parachute Battalion he defied heavy
enemy fire to treat casualties sustained in a parachute drop east of the Rhine near Wesel.
Rejecting treatment for his own severe face wounds he continued to rescue the injured for
six hours. While returning to his company he saved three occupants of a burning carrier
which was in danger of exploding. For these exceptional deeds Topham was awarded the
Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for valour in the British Commonwealth.

Corporal Topham laid the cornerstone at Sunnybrook Memorial Hospital on November
10, 1945 and also the cornerstone of Legion Branch 266 our present building on May 11,
1946. After the war he resided in Etobicoke, worked as an emergency repairman for
Toronto Hydro and became a member of Maple Leaf Branch 266. He died suddenly on
May 31 1971 at the age of 54.

THE LADIES AUXILIARY OF MAPLE LEAF BRANCH 266

The organizers of Branch 266 Ladies Auxiliary held their first meeting in King George
school on St John’s Road with about 26 members present and a Mrs. Pegg in the chair.

After gaining their charter on April 17, 1942 they held card games in each others homes
every week to raise money for the equipment needed to furnish a kitchen in the Branch
Hall and also to buy wool to knit for the army. They campaigned with the men on poppy
days and worked hard at veterans functions. During the war many of the ladies went
down to Union Station to meet the soldiers and help check their bags and give them meal
tickets if they were waiting to meet other trains.

The ladies often visited Park View Lodge where there were always quite a number of war
brides of veterans still overseas who had no one here. They were always pleased to see
the Ladies Auxiliary and receive their goodies and a little cash. The ladies also formed a
kitchen band and went to different clubs and played old-time songs, which everyone
enjoyed greatly.

From these somewhat humble beginnings, the Branch 266 Ladies’ Auxiliary has grown to
more than 80 members. They are ever active in their support of the Branch and the
community. A pet project for many years has been their weekly euchre, held every
Thursday evening in the upstairs hall.

CUTLINES

Located on the west side of Jane Street just before Dundas Streed and decorated here with
Union Jack and Victoria Bond Poser early in the Second World War, this bungalow
served as quarters for Maple Leaf Branch 266 from about 1931 to 1943. The sign above
the doorway reads “Canadian Legion - B.E.S.L. Post 266. In those days, Legion branches
were sometimes termed "posts".

In 1943 the members of Post 266 transplanted their doorway sign to this old farmhouse
on Dundas Street West, in which they held their meetings and social functions until a new
building was erected on the site in 1946 - 47.

The new building, erected at 359_ Dundas Street West on a cornerstone laid by Victoria
Cross winner and Branch 266 member “Toppy” Topham on May 11, 1946, was officially opened in 1941 and has served the members admireably ever since.

CORONATION BRANCH 286
OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN LEGION

On November 11, 1918 at the close of the Great World War it was time to go home for
the thousands of Canadians service their country in faraway places.

Shortly after their return a national organization was formed known as the Great War
Veterans Association. This organization along with others was founded to provide
assistance in meeting the needs of veterans and their families.

In 1926, the GWVA, the Canadian Legion, and the British Empire Service League
merged into a new group named the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
League. A charter in this organization was granted to Coronation Branch 286 on April 2,
1937. On April 5, 1939 a charter was received by the Ladies Auxiliary.

Under the leadership of Padre R. Davidson, charter president of the new branch the first
executive was formed and the tough paths ahead were laid down for consideration.

To begin with executive meetings were held in private homes of members and a 5 cent
levy per member was paid to the homeowner. One of the first decisions made was with
regard to membership dues, which were decided as follows: “Annual membership fee to
be $2 per annum and in the event that a member be in dire straights, payment would be
accepted at 50 cents quarterly.

The property on which the Branch now stands was donated by Mr. Bert Irwin, a
prominent member of the community on Irwin Road on which the Branch is located, was
named after him. Donation of the land enabled the executive to plan construction of the
original building of Branch 286 with a small but dedicated membership, constructed
went ahead with donated materials and voluntary labour, a way in which most Legion
Branches began operations. The first premises to be constructed consisted of a single
story facility, which from 1942 to 1949 was also used by the local Board of Education
during daytime hours as a school.

A volunteer firehall was located on the northwest corner of the property on Invin Road,
which served as a temporary home for special and executive meetings until such time at
the new facility was opened and dedicated by the Branch.

As membership increased in the year that followed and new Legion comrades expressed a
desire to participate actively, stand for office, and become leaders in furthering the aims
and objects of the organization, plans for improvement and extension of the hall were initiated.

Page 31
Thence from that single story premises on the original 2 acre property we now enjoy a
facility that includes a banquet and assembly hall that accommodates up to 200 people, a
dining room run by the Ladies Auxiliary, a lounge with full bar, a downstairs bar and
lounge and a fully equipped clubroom.

Plans for the future include further extension of Irwin Hall with a view to increasing
banquet accommodations and providing a new cloakroom and storage areas and a
wheelchair access to washrooms.

Over the years the service bureau of Branch 286 has been fully supportive not only of
veteran members, but also in compliance with Royal Legion dictates of non members
with veteran status in times of need. A representative of the Federal Department of
Veterans Affairs visits the branch on the first Wednesday of the month to listen and offer 
guidance to any veteran requiring assistance.

Beside caring for personal needs, we arrange for hospitalized veterans to visit the Branch
for various social functions and entertainment. The committee responsible for these
activities also runs bingo evenings at Sunnybrook Hospital on a regular schedule, so that
those unable to attend our functions the Branch still receive our care and attention.

The Legion’s involvement in community affairs and its support of senior citizens groups
is far reaching throughout Metro Toronto and district and not confined to our own
immediate area. Over the years money has been donated to Metro Toronto Legion
Village, Metro Toronto Finchurst Legion Homes, Etobicoke Seniors Homes in Rexdale
and Etobicoke Parks and Recreation for seniors, also the St. John Ambulance, the Cancer
Fund, Woodstock and Barrie Disaster Funds, Hospital for Sick Children, Etobicoke
General Hospital, Salvation Army, Arthritis Society, World Vision Organization, War
Amps, Annual Metro Toronto Police Games and the Canadian National Games.

Junior activities also receive donations such as the Etobicoke Swim-A-Thon, Rexdale
Soccer, bowling, baseball, softball, hockey, scouts, boxing and the Navy and Air Force
cadets, and our banquet hall has been made available for all sorts of local youth functions
at no charge.

Another important part of our community support is that afforded to the eight high
schools in the area. Bursaries and other scholastic awards are put forward annually to
encourage recipients to further their education and commit themselves to involvement in
business and vocational training.

Donations to community projects from Branch 286 from 1980 through 1985, have
totalled $81,088.

Students within Branch 286 poppy area are invited annually to compete for Legion
awards in the essay, poem, posters and public speaking competitions. The elementary
and secondary have proved to be very supporting in encouraging their students to take
active part in this, our Youth Education Program.

On parade, Branch 286 has always been strong in turnout, and has been well led by its
presidents, pipe band and colour parties. Unfortunately in recent years our own band has
folded and we have had to seek the support of others to lead us when needed. This has
proved successful and with a full colour party we have been able to compete with the best
in Toronto Zone D! Command. Annual parades include Warriors Day at the CNE, our
annual D-Day service at Sanctuary Park and the Branch‘s Remembrance Service held
each year during Legion Week and on November 11 - the national day of Remembrance.

Brigade 286 of the Order of the St. John Ambulance accompany us on most parades.
They are the first St. John Brigade in Canada to be sponsored by a branch of the Royal
Canadian Legion. They bear the number of our Branch 286.

Branch sports activities have been expanded over the years to include not only indoor
sports but also outdoor sports.

Bowling league teams have been competing since 1951 and curling since 1958 both
continue to thrive. Indoor activities include darts, shuffleboard, snooker, euchre and
cribbage and in summer there’s our golf tournaments and fun days.

Awards won in various events at the Zone, District and Provincial levels are on display in
the Branch’s clubrooms.

Entertainment in the Branch has seen many changes in our 42 years of operation, but with
awareness for the need to enjoy celebrative times together, the opportunity to do so has
never been overlooked. For instance, the first Branch picnic in 1938 involved a boat trip
to Port Dalhousie at a return fare of 20 cents.

Although prices since then have increased dramatically, out annual New Years Eve
dances, Monte Carlo Nights, corn roasts and ham and turkey rolls continue to receive
full support.

The children are not forgotten either. Over the years their introduction to an inclusion in
Legion events should be a memorial held dear to them, summer picnics, Christmas
parties, Warriors Day Parades at the CNE and the visits from Santa Clause at Christmas-
time.

Bingo commenced in 1937 and continues to this day. It attracts not only members of the
branch, but also the local community who have always been made welcome.

In this the Diamond Jubilee of the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 286 has been strong in
support of the 60th anniversary celebrations. The special tulips imported from Holland, a
special strain, blood red in colour and plated last fall will have bloomed by now as a
symbol of our Remembrance of Them. Ceremonies and celebrations are not over yet -
much is planned to round our commemorative year.

To forget the service given by the Ladies Auxiliary of Branch 286 during our years of
struggle would be remissful. To begin with their strength in numbers was scant, but their
response at the outbreak of the Second World War was typical of a determined group of
women to help in a time of need. They raised funds in conjunction with other branches to
assist and supply comfort to troops overseas. Their efforts after hostilities were devoted
to raising funds for the improvements of the Branch’s facilities and to the introduction of
catering to social and private events. Our ladies continue to uphold the aims and objects
of the Royal Canadian Legion and hope to receive help from younger members now
joining the ranks. It is a tribute to the Ladies Auxiliary and their indefatigable spirit that
the group continues to be a vital and enduring unit of the Branch.

We continue strong in our endeavor and with Pride in our Past, Faith in our Future - we
will dedicate ourselves with fervor to all future commitments.

MALTON LEGION BRANCH 528

Malton veterans of World War 2 were not as slow as those of the First World War in
organizing veterans service groups, but their reasons for uniting were the same as those
of the Royal Canadian Legion's founders sixty years ago, in 1926.

After the second world war, the veterans of Malton felt the need to unite for social
contact and comradeship, as well as an urge to serve their community in peacetime. Thence, the Malton Veterans’
Association was formed in the late forties.

After much struggle to hold the Association together, an application for a Branch Charter in the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
League was accepted, and the charter granted. So it was that Branch 528 Malton was
born in the fall of 1951.

The first years as a branch of the Canadian Legion were an up-hill climb. Fora branch
without a "home" there wasn't much to offer a fellow veteran except a membership
card.

Community facilities and civic utilities in Malton at that time, were little better than
those to be found in the boon-docks.

Social activities were limited to one or two a year. Old die-hard prohibitionists did
little to promote a feeling of "good will" toward this new veterans’ organization now
established within the community.

The lean years rolled by, with very little growth in membership and little broadening of
activities. Not until Branch 528 gained a voice in municipal government through an
incumbent president did they get a break. Public utilities and even paved streets and
parking areas were installed at local recreational facilities. These improvements were
the turning point in Branch 528's early life.

A big increase in social activities resulted, and membership in the Branch grew by
leaps and bounds. As the community's growth continued, so did the Branch's.

Attempts were then begun to locate a suitable place to call home. During this time,
efforts were increased to build up the Branch's prestige in the community through
sponsorship of kids' hockey teams and Boy Scout groups. Relief provided for victims
of Hurricane Hazel by the Branch did much to convince the citizens of Malton of the
sincerity of the efforts of Branch 528 in its role as a service organization dedicated not
only to its own members, but also to the community as a whole.

Page 36

Meanwhile, funds were being built up for the day when the Branch might find a permanent home. The opportunity came in 1960 with the
enlargement of Malton Airport and the offer for sale by the government of many nearby
barracks buildings. One of these, the clubhouse of the Toronto Flying Club, which
included a dancehall was procured, and Branch 528 members never looked back.

Despite a mountain-size mortgage and only about a hundred willing hands, the
Branch survived. In those early days it was considered to be the "poor country-cousin"
by the other branches of District ‘D' Command. To-day, it is recognized as being
second to none in the greater Toronto area.

The members of Branch 528 can be rightly proud of their standing in Ontario
Provincial Command. They have made substantial contributions to Legion work in
general, and to the community of Malton especially.

For the past twenty years or more, Branch 528 has been a strong supporter of youth
sports groups in the community as well as some outside Malton. It also donates
thousands of dollars each year to various charitable foundations, including Legion
housing projects operated for veterans and spouses by District ~D' Command.

The community of Malton has seen and felt the work done in the community by the
different committees of Branch 528. Legion Memorial Gardens in Wildwood Park,
with its beautiful cenotaph and mounted CF-100, is a landmark put there by hard
working members of Branch 528 and certainly goes a long way in enhancing the
beauty of Malton as well as creating a feeling of pride in the community itself. The
students of Malton are also aware of the influence of Branch 528 through members’
work in youth education in support of school projects and presentations of bursaries.
The efforts of the Branch's Youth Education Committee have uncovered much talent
in the area schools, so much so that one student in the area recently won a Dominion
award for the best Remembrance Day poster in its class.

Major contributions to the welfare of Malton and area residents have included the
following:
 - a new Station wagon donated to the Malton branch of the Canadian Cancer Society in 1980.
 - $10,000 to the Etobicoke General Hospital in 1982 toward the purchase of a Computer-Assisted Tomographic (CAT) scanner.
 - $6,000.00 to the Malton Community Council in 1984.

Truly, the members of Malton Branch 528 of the Royal Canadian Legion, in this their
»35th year, can stand up with the rest of the branches across Canada in this, the Legion's
Diamond Jubilee Year and proudly say, "Pride in Our Past--Faith in Our Future".

A Tribute to the Malton Legion Ladies

The members of Malton Branch 528 would be remiss if they failed to mention their
Ladies Auxiliary. Once the Branch had gained a permanent home, the ladies were not
long in organizing themselves into one of the finest auxiliaries in the country. They
obtained their charter on January 8, 1961.

Their untiring efforts over the past twenty-five years have brought many thousands
of dollars to the coffers of Branch 528. Their excellent catering skills have drawn
countless people to the banquet hall to celebrate weddings and anniversaries, and to
attend dinner meetings and parties of a wide variety, boosting rentals of the facility
almost to the limit. ever has so much been owed to so few.

Aside from their willingness to help the Branch at all times, these hard-working, generous girls also give their full share of support to the Provincial
Command Ladies Auxiliary body each year.

A Padre's Message

The sixtieth anniversary year of the Royal Canadian Legion makes 1986 a singular
historic year. It means that the Legion has grown in age--from its early years, through
middle age, and now goes on!

The Legion proceeds now with a treasury of experience, good leadership, public
understanding, and an energetic building programme throughout all Canada.

This rich heritage brings with it a responsibility--to serve needy veterans and their
families. Because of our age, which the membership reflects, parades with banners
flying and crowds applauding will become shorter in marching distance, and may even
dwindle to a few in number in the next ten years.

The Legion will have to measure its programmes for November 11th, and perhaps
provide new formats for aging veterans. However, the Legion is relevant, and will
adopt programmes and actions to continue to serve.

There will always be the Royal Canadian Legion. And, the Act of Remembrance is our
sacred trust.

The opening ritual of Legion general meetings often includes initiation of new members.
Here are fourteen initiates repeating the oath of allegiance after President Nat Pollock,
during a mass initiation at Long Branch Br. 101 on April 17, 1967. Can you pick them
out?

HMCS LONG BRANCH

The corvette HMCS Long Branch was launched at Clydebank on August 30, 1943. After
being commissioned on January 5, 1944, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy
as part of an exchange for Canadian-built Algerine minesweepers,and saw active service
escorting North Atlantic convoys and hunting submarines out of Halifax. She was
immediately adopted by the villagers of Long Branch and her crews welcomed the gift
parcels of | "smokes", knit-wear and heavy blankets provided regularly by Branch 101
and the Ladies Auxiliary, and by other community organizations. Bearing identification
K487, she was paid off on June 17, 1945, and saw merchant marine service until being
scrapped in 1966. At that time, the ship's watch bell was presented to the Branch,but its
whereabouts is now unknown.

CANADA'S FIRST AERODROME

In May 1915, Canada's first aerodrome and flying school was established in Long
Branch, on the site now occupied by Ontario

Hydro's Lakeview Generating Station. The school was managed by

John A.D. McCurdy, Canada's first aviator. Most of the graduates went England at their
own expense to join either the Royal Flying Corps or the Royal Naval Air Service.

Here we see a graduating class posing before three 2-seater, twin-control biplanes

believed to be JN-3's, twelve of which were produced by Curtis Aeroplanes & Motors on
Strachan Avenue in Toronto during 1915. (Photo source unknown)

ZONE D-1 PUBLICITY REPORT
April 1986

Comrades,

Nineteen representatives were on hand last Saturday morning, the 19th, at Malton Branch
528, for the second workshop on the Jubilee newspaper supplement.

Attendees included District D Commander Roy Kennett, Zone Commanders Fran
Antrobus and Ray Knibbs of Zone D-1 and D-2, respectively, Deputy Zone Commanders
Wilf Prendergast and Ernie Halcrow of D-1 and D-2, and most of the branch Jubilee
chairmen, publicity officers and/or newsletter editors.

Material was received from seven of the eight participating branches and is now being
processed for publication. It is hoped that the eighth will respond soon to avoid serious
disruption of printing schedules.

A wider offering of photos would still be helpful, and short items on "this-and-that"
would be useful as filler material. The matter of purchased space for joint promotion of
the branches and their facilities remains to be resolved with some of the participating
branches. But, overall, it looks like all systems are "go".

My thanks are extended to Carole Johnson who again acted as chief coffee-maker and
secretary for the morning's proceedings, and to manager Bert Reid and the members of
Malton Branch 528 for complimentary use of their executive meeting room for the
second time on this project.

If no one has beat me to it, I wish to announce that the venerable Mel Heisler of Malton

Br. 528 will be presented with the 1986 Volunteer Service Award by the Ontario
Ministry of Citizenship and Culture at Kitchener next Tuesday, the 29th.

The award recognizes Mel's outstanding contribution to scouting in the Malton
Thunderbird District during his many years of residence in the area, and relates also to his
long and dedicated service to his church and to thé Royal Canadian Legion.

That concludes my report for April.

Respectfully submitted
in Comradeship,

R.A. Johnson
